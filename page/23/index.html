				<p>Today there was to be no gambling… A day I never thought was possible. After I got up at around 5 PM I went with Morten to the Hooters hotel &amp; casino to dine and look around. The Hooters girls are in a class of their own, they’re much nicer than most of the Spearmint girls, I simply have to stay at this hotel at some point!</p>

<p>Unfortunately when we got our pics taken we didn’t switch cameras, so I’ve got the picture of Sally (our lovely waitress) together with Morten and vice versa, but nevermind, Sally’s what’s interesting in this picture.</p>
<p>Afterwards we went to the Las Vegas premium outlets to do some shopping. Damn it’s cheap! I went nuts in the Tommy Hilfiger shop, expecting the bill to be around $5-600 (which I’d still perceive as cheap)… It didn’t pass $200. You can really do some scoops here when it comes to clothe shopping!</p>

<p>Afterwards we went to the Stratosphere to enjoy the view and look at the rides. Unfortunately due to all our shopping bags we couldn’t take the rides as we didn’t really feel like leaving our bags on the ground in the mean time. I might go to the Stratosphere one of the next days, I really wanna take the Big Shot ride.</p>

				<p>Today we wanted to try a buffet, not something I’ve done a lot of over here (except the Aladdin buffet which wasn’t really that good). Me and three others went to the Wynn, a rather new and very grand hotel to test their buffet. Compared to the Aladdin this one was far superior. Only downside is that their speciality was seafood, which isn’t exactly my kinda thing. Anyways, it was great food and a great scenery!</p>

<p>After eating at the Wynn we went downtown to Fremont Street to see the incredible lightshows.</p>

<p>Hanging above Fremont Street is a “monitor” of unimagineable size, literally covering the whole street. On this monitor area shows are being shown each our from 7 PM until midnight. Different shows are shown at different times, unfortunately we only had the time to see one of them (as we arrived near midnight). Although the picture quality isn’t really that great due to lack of light and very changing light conditions, it should be rather easy to notice that the show contained a lot of lightly clothed women - not bad!</p>

<p>Afterwards we went into the 4 Queens casino &amp; hotel to play some serious -EV games! I had major SKRUB in the Texas Holdem table game, hitting several bonuses with a max bonus bet of $50 (all of downtown is low stakes unfortunately). On one hand I hit AA with $50 on the bonus field, giving 30:1 back - not bad. Afterwards I made a major hit on a “Wheel of Fortune” slot machine, netting around $500. All in all I ended up around $1500-$2000 purely by playing -EV games… -EV - I say not!</p>
<p>Tomorrow is my last day over here. I really could’ve used a week or two more, I am not looking forward to the prospect of going home. Sure it’s going to be nice to see folks at home, get a glass of real milk, eat real food and so forth, but I’m not looking forward to the amount of work and school stuff waiting for me to come home.</p>
<p>Tomorrow we’ve talked about visiting the Las Vegas Gun Shop to try some AK47’s, UZI’s and similar cool guns. Afterwards we might take a trip to the Stratosphere to finally try some of the rides. We’ll round off the night by seing Jay Leno at the Mirage at 10:30 PM that night.</p>
<p>My plane leaves at around 8 AM saturday. Due to the recent terrorist plots discovered in the UK, I’m not really sure how much trouble I’ll have while flying home. I’m fearing I might not have enough transit time in the airports due to the increased security checks and so forth. Worst case scenario is that I’ll be forced to get a later plane, delaying my arrival time at home.</p>

				<p>The last $1500 NLHE event was starting at 10 AM, so I really had to get up early. Though I’d never be able to do so at home, I actually managed to get up at 8 AM and get to the Rio at 9 AM. When I registered I was told that the tournament wasn’t starting until 11 AM though - it seems I messed up in the dates, the last $1500 event was actually tomorrow, not today.</p>
<a id="more"></a>

<p>After eating breakfast I still had one and a half hours of time to kill… So I found myself a free CardPlayer magazine and sat down at a slot machine. One of the female attendants came over jokingly asking me why I’d just sit there playing the slots while reading the magazine, I didn’t really look like the typical slot player, hardly interested in the slot machine itself. I ran good, really good. When I went back to play I’d built up a surplus of $800 on the slot machine, not bad!</p>
<p>The tournament itself was yet another disappointment. I finally today realized how awfully bad the structure is. I ran card dead for the first hour, and at that point I only had around $800 back, 20 BBs. These tournaments start with $1500 stacks, 25/25 blinds that rise every hour (about 25 hands/hour). It is simply a disgrace to call these events for WSOP events, and even more of a disgrace that there are bracelets for the winner of these events, since there’s rarely more than 350-400 participants.</p>
<p>A couple of pictures showing the final four tables of the WSOP ME:</p>
<div class="imgwrapper" style=""><div><a href="/nomore1500nlhe/wsop4_2.jpg" class="fancy"><img src="/nomore1500nlhe/wsop4_2.jpg" style="max-height: 250px"/></a></div></div>

<p>Later in the day I went to the Mirage with a couple of the others to play some $2/5 NL. Mirage had a nice room, although I don’t really like their cards (KEM) when compared to the WSOP Copag cards. Also their brush was working a manual list that wasn’t visible to players. To sum up the play, I ended down around $900, most of it due to the last pot I played. Me and Joachim had just agreed that this would be our last hand before we’d go (I was UTG, just before the BB). So I look down, and what do I see? Black kings! I raise it up to $20. I get a single caller in MP from an extremely tight player - really, really tight. The flop comes 646r. I bet out 3/4 pot, he calls. At this point I really only fear hands like 44, 66 and pairs 77-AA. 66 is unlikely though, so is QQ-AA as he’d have reraised me preflop with those holdings. Turn is another 6 which counterfeits his 44 full house in case he has that one. I bet 3/4 pot, he calls. River is a jack, a pretty blank card unless he has JJ, I’m pretty sure he’d have raised me earlier with JJ though. I bet out 1/2 pot, and he immediatly goes all in. I have to call as the pot is now very big. He turns up A6o for the turned quads, and he rakes in the almost $1k pot. I have no idea how these awfully tight players suddenly wake up, calling a $20 UTG raise with utter crap.</p>
<p>Later on we went to the Venetian to play some $1/2 donk NL. Venetian has a spectacular room! Great scenery, great tables (although I don’t like their felt as much as the Rios) and above average cocktail services. Also this was the juiciest $1/2 table I have <em>ever</em> seen, it is unbelievable, I can’t even describe it. Just imagine people calling down with ace high all the time, that about sums it up. I ended up $32 after about 5 hours play due to me donking it up with the other sjufts at the table.</p>

				<p>Today was the second last $1500 NLHE event of this years WSOP. I went to bed at 8 PM the night before and slept all the way until 9 AM so I couldn’t blame my performance on lack of sleep today - unfortunately.</p>
<a id="more"></a>

<p>I had Bill Chen (2-time WSOP bracelet winner in the 2006 series!) and Max Pescatori (1-time WSOP bracelet winner in the 2006 series) to my left, there were definitely a couple of other pros at the table, but those were the only two I really recognized. Also Joe Hachem was sitting at the table right next to mine.</p>
<p>The funny thing about these $1500 events is that they’re actually a lot tougher than the main event! The pro/amateur ratio on the tables are a lot less than in the main event. Also due to the small stack structure you really can’t afford to make any mistakes. Max played a very crazy game, making some insane preflop pushes, trying to push people off hands. He’d been caught with J7o, 22, 99 and various other weird hands, and amazingly he’d won even though he went in as an underdog every time. Bill played rather ABC, but I noticed he’d made a lot of squeeze plays. In general it seemed like he had great perception of the table situation and he was able to take down a lot of pots without going to showdown.</p>
<p>I started out absolutely great! Though I do not remember all the hands any more, I managed to build my chipstack up to chipleader status within the first couple of hours, having nearly 18k when the average was around 3k. Unfortunately my luck ended suddenly. It started out in a pot where I had TT on the button. Blinds are 100/200. LP pushes all in for about 1500. I look down on my tens, I just smooth call, I don’t want to risk all of my stack by isolating since Max was sitting on a stack of around 10-12k himself. After my call, Bill pushes his stack in, and Max folds. I count up Bills chips, around 4000… Hmm, I’d seen him do this before and I was pretty convinced that he was trying to squueze me out with a mediocre hand since LP could’ve had any two more or less, so I called. Bill showed QQ, yuck, LP showed 97s, more or less as expected. The flop didn’t help me, and to make things worse, I’d overseen a couple of pinks in Bills stack, so he didn’t have around 4k, he had 6k, ouch.</p>
<p>I made a couple of great calls on the flop later on with marginal hands, nothing held up unfortunately. In a series of about four or five showdowns that I didn’t win, my stack simply dwindled away. When our table broke up I had about 3k left with blinds of 150/300 + 25 ante. I was moved to table 1 and by chance Bill sat to my direct left again. Second hand at the table it gets folded around to me, I’ve got black jacks, I push. BB thinks for a while and then calls with AT. Flop comes: AT8, Turn: T, River: no jack. I’m out. Bill gives me his hand and congratulates me on my play and gives me consolation for busting out in this way. At this time there were around 80 left in the tournamnet (420 to start), payout to top 45. Dammit.</p>
<p>Tomorrow is the very last WSOP event of this years world series. It’s also a $1500 NLHE event. It’s going to be tough getting up since it starts at 10 AM, but I’m destined to give this my very best try… This is my last chance at getting a bracelet and thereby setting the record for youngest bracelet winner ever.</p>

				<p>I got back home from Spearmint at around 7:30 AM, pretty wasted to say the least. I know from experience that setting my alarm clock on my cell phone won’t help as I’ll just keep sleeping if I don’t have a life threatening reason to get out of bed, so I’d just sleep until I woke up.</p>
<a id="more"></a>

<p>I woke up just three hours later at around 11 AM… Hmm, I really did plan to get just a little bit more slep, or else I’d be completely burned out that night. I closed my eyes for a second… When I woke up again it was dark outside, it was 8:30 PM, yikes, that was a bit longer than I’d anticipated.</p>
<p>I had planned on playing the $1500 NLHE WSOP event on the next day, so this really fucked up my plans as my sleeping pattern was now pretty awkward. The WSOP event started at 11 AM that very next morning, and the event will run for up to 12 hours, so there would be no doubt that I’d be near death if I were to last that long.</p>
<p>I ended up getting a 20 minute power nap that night before I took a cab to the Rio at 9 AM to get some breakfast, register for the WSOP event and get myself prepared.</p>
<p>I was actually quite awake even though I’d been up for some hours by that time, so I felt prepared. The tournament was a short experience unfortunately, and I can’t blame anyone but myself. I made a terrible call in a pot that should’ve been an easy laydown.</p>
<p>I had around 1800, I’d just been moved to a new table, having Hassan Habib right across the table, and Vanessa Rousso (very cute) to my right. I get <strong>A</strong>h<strong>J</strong>c in MP with a single caller before me (blinds 25/25). I make it 150, I get two callers. The flop comes <strong>J</strong>s<strong>3</strong>d<strong>2</strong>d which is nearly perfect for me. Checked to me, I bet out around 350 out, both callers call again. The turn comes with a scary <strong>6</strong>d. Now suddenly the EP caller bets out the pot, effectively putting me all in. I pondered over this bet a long time, why would he bet out this hard if he’d made his flush? Wouldn’t he either be going for the checkraise or simply betting less strongly to induce a raise? I ended up reasoning with myself that he must’ve had some kind of semi weak holding like KJ, TJ, 9J or something similar, and he wanted to take down the pot now using the scare card / bet. I pushed all in. Both callers instacalled - yuck. The LP caller showed 22 for the flopped set, and the EP caller show <strong>7</strong>d<strong>9</strong>d. I was drawing dead. The river brought the <strong>3</strong>s to fill up the LP caller, raking in a massive pot.</p>
<p>Having just 125 chips left I managed to triple up. Unfortunately I busted out with AQs against Vanessa’s AKo, fair’n’square. I didn’t last more than one and a half our. I really can’t believe I didn’t manage to fold that hand now that I’ve thought it through.</p>
<p>It’s now 7:30 PM and I’m going to bed. I wanna be really rested when I’m playing the next $1500 NLHE event tomorrow (there are two $1500 NLHE events left that I’m going to play).</p>

				<p>At last I got a good nights sleep before the big day, day three of the 2006 WSOP Main Event!</p>
<a id="more"></a>

<div class="imgwrapper" style=""><div><a href="/mainevent3/partay13_2.jpg" class="fancy"><img src="/mainevent3/partay13_2.jpg" style="max-height: 250px"/></a></div></div>

<p>I had my strategy totally planned, I knew all about the guys at my table (as written in an earlier blog entry), knew about the chip stacks, who to bully and so forth. I was prepared.</p>
<p>My strategy was to play pretty tight and semi passive up until the bubble (which would probably arrive after 4-5 hours). Utilizing this strategy would avoid marginal situations that could bust me before the bubble, as well as establishing a great tight passive image that I could use on the bubble to steal a lot of pots.</p>
<p>I started out great, folded all hands for the first 15 minutes at my table, then something unexpected occurred. I heard a couple of “Sir…” behind my back, though I didn’t relly think about it. Then someone tapped me and my shoulder and said “Excuse me sir…”, I looked around and there were a floor man. “We need to move you sir, please rack up your chips and follow me”. Shit, this was <em>not</em> what I needed! I had no choice though, very bad timing resulted in our table needing a man to be moved, and I was just about to receive the big blind (qualifying me to be moved), dammit!</p>
<p>I sit down at my new table, luckily I don’t see any immediatly recognizable faces which is good. The bad news is that the average stack on this table were vastly larger than at my old table, there were probably not more than one or two stacks smaller than mine, and there were a couple of 200k stacks, yuck!</p>
<p>After playing about 10 minutes on the table I realized that my tight passive strategy wouldn’t hold up on this table. Most of the players were playing a good loose aggresive strategy which resulted in me being stolen from constantly, a lot of raised pots and so forth. It was clear to me that I had to make a stand to avoid being stolen too much from, and in general to survive / build my stack before the bubble.</p>
<p>About half an hour in I receive a hand, <strong>4s4c</strong> in MP. My stack is around 90k, blinds are 800/1600 + 200 ante. I raise it up to 5k, I get a single caller on the button, a big stack with around 250k. My read on this guys is that he’s playing a lot of pots (which isn’t that bad when you’re a big stack), though he seems to be playing rather bad postflop, and also he seems to be playing a bit too loose aggresive for his own good.</p>
<p>The flop comes something like <strong>As5h9d</strong>. I bet out around 7k, my standard bet, no matter if I hit or miss. He calls. The turn comes with the <strong>Td</strong>. I don’t want to invest too much into this pot with my weak holding so I check. He thinks for 10 seconds before he also checks. His check here reassures me he doesn’t have anything on this flop, at least nothing strong. Also there are no obvious draws, so I’m actually feeling pretty good. He might have the 5 or a smaller pair that hasn’t hit. Now the turn brings a <strong>Kc</strong> which I can’t really see improving his hand. I still don’t want to invest too much, I’d puke if I bet out here and he raised me, since I’d have to fold. I check, he thinks for about 20 seconds before he bets out 10k. 10k is a rather weak bet, and it confirms my suspicion that he’s weak, I’m pretty sure he’d bet stronger if he had a better hand. I think for 30 seconds before I say “Make it 25k” - so much for playing tight passive…</p>
<p>He sighs and folds his hand. Great start! I’m up to around 120k. When the bubble bursts, the average stack will be about 100k, so I’m in a great spot here.</p>
<p>A bit later I get into a almost identical hand with the same opponent. I get <strong>2h2d</strong> in MP, raise it up to 5k, he calls in the blinds. The flop comes <strong>Kd3h7d</strong>. He checks, I check. Flop comes with a non diamond ace, suit doesn’t matter. It goes check check again. River brings an unimportant rag (again no diamond). He bets out about 7500 into a pot of around 20k. I’m not really sure I made the correct decision here, I feel he may have a drawing hand like TJ, JQ or some kind of diamond combination that hasn’t hit. I call and he shows A9 for the turned ace, and he takes it down. In hind sight I’m not sure I should’ve called, but following my reads had worked pretty good so far. After this hand I’m down to around 85k.</p>
<p>After some time I receive <strong>TsTc</strong> in the big blind, my stack’s around 80k. It’s folded around to a rather aggresive good swedish player who’d stolen a lot previously. He makes it 6k preflop. I quickly make it 14k. He thinks shortly and then calls. Flop comes <strong>Ad2c9d</strong>. The pot’s a good 30k so I bet out 20k, he quickly pushes all in, yuck. I’m pretty sure he wouldn’t do this without having hit the flop as were even stacked and loosing this hand would bust him from the tournament, pretty close to the bubble. I also can’t see him doing this with a hand having hit neither the 2 nor the 9, so I’m pretty sure he has a raggy ace or possibly a mid pair. Now, I could call and bust him if he had 33-88, though it is possible that he had JJ-AA also, either making a tricky preflop play with the AA’s or simply putting me on a resteal (which would be a reasonable assumption due to his history of steals), hence not believing I’ve hit the ace. I simply can’t see myself calling this, so I end up folding, bringing my stack down around 40k, possibly a bit less.</p>
<p>At this point we’re only about 30 away from the money, so suddenly my strategy changes. Now my main priority is no longer to build my stack, it’s simply to make the money and then reconsider at that point. The next hour is a boring hour, I hate shortstacked play on the bubble as I have no options, and I’m too easy to push around with a lot of big stacks on the table. I end up not playing any hands at all, even folding AJ to a LP raise (I won’t run the risk of them busting me only 5 people away from the $15k bubble).</p>
<p>A bit before hitting the money, Jacob Juhl joins my table, sitting right across the table from me. He’s a great guy, rooting for me to make the money, thanks!</p>
<p>We finally hit the money, at this point my stack’s around 26k, terrible. An Acemag reporter comes by to check on mine and Jacob’s stack and I tell him, “I’m either out in 5 minutes, or I’ve tripled”. The WSOP Main Event payout structure is absolutely terrible, it’s increidbly flat, you need to hit top 81 before the prizes start to really increase. The next 5 or 6 prize steps from top 873 increase the prize by only $1k or so, thereafter it increases by $2k for some steps. The flat structure really makes it necessary to gamble after you’ve hit the money, you have to build a stack to go deep, hence my quote to the Acemag reporter.</p>
<p>Just a few hands later I receive<strong> JhQh</strong> in the blinds. An EP weak player (very easy to push off hands) raises to 6k (blinds 1k/2k + 300 ante). I push my 26k in, knowing I probably have to live cards in case he calls, though I naturally run the risk of him having AA/KK/QQ, AQ, AJ or other terrible hands. He folds and I rake in the pot of a round 34k.</p>
<p>A couple of hands later I receive <strong>KsJs</strong> in late position. It’s folded around to me, and although I have rethought this hand a lot, I can’t see me folding this. I raise it up to 6k (which is the table standard). The bigstack loose aggro caller calls from the blinds, and a rather anonymous player calls from the button. The flop comes with a perfect <strong>Jh3d5c</strong>. Since the pot’s already about 25k due to the calls, antes and blinds, I simply push in my about 25k. The button player thinks shortly and then announces call, the laggy player folds. He tables AJ, I’m in very bad shape, I’m dominated - looking for a K to help me out. Unfortunately I don’t improve, and I’m out.</p>
<p>After the bubble burst people are busting like crazy. We’re probably loosing about 5 people per minute (about 90 tables left). When you bust out the procedure is to stand up and wait for you to be escorted out by an official, to make sure you get the correct bustout place recorded and so forth. This is great in theory, but when 50 people bust out within 10 minutes, they’re seriously understaffed. This resulted in me having to stand at my table for 10 minutes, just thinking about the bust, nothing else. It was terrible not being able to simply walk away. Right after a bust - especially from the greatest tournament of all times - you feel incredibly flat. Could you avoid the bust? What did I do wrong? All the prize money I could’ve won.</p>
<p>After the 10 minutes had passed, the floor man instructing me to wait had to excuse them being so slow to escort people out, after which he simply escorted me out himself (though it wasn’t his duty to do so). I didn’t blame him as he was in no way to be blamed for it. After busting, you get escorted to a podium in the middle where your seat / name is reported, and then you get a little yellow sticker with your bustout position (#822) as wells as your prize money. This poses a problem as your bustout position isn’t reliant on the time you actually bust, but on the order in which you receive your bustout note. I was just 2 places away from a higher payout step (+$1k), so if I hadf just stood around 30 seconds more, I would’ve received $1k more. Of course this is primarily a problem around the bubble when so many people bust, but still, it doesn’t seem reasonable.</p>
<p>I got the money in cash, and wow, what a feeling. Although I have a bankroll of more than $15k, never before had I held such a large bunch of benjamins ($100 bills) in my hand. I felt terribly nervous, walking around with that much cash in my pocket. Luckily I met up with Frederik and his father who were also on their way home, we took a cab together.</p>
<div class="imgwrapper" style=""><div><a href="/mainevent3/partay1_2.jpg" class="fancy"><img src="/mainevent3/partay1_2.jpg" style="max-height: 250px"/></a></div></div>

<p>After arriving at home, telling everybody about how I busted and leaving the cash in my backpack, we prepared to head for town. The others were planning to go the the Aladdin and play some crazy donkfest cash games, although I’d just busted, I couldn’t resist joining. I got a quick bath, and off we went.</p>
<div class="imgwrapper" style=""><div><a href="/mainevent3/partay2_2.jpg" class="fancy"><img src="/mainevent3/partay2_2.jpg" style="max-height: 250px"/></a></div></div>

<p>By coincidense we met up with Klaphat and a couple of his friends so we ended up being 10 people, just perfect for a private game! We convinced the Aladdin to open up a table for us. Due to Nevada laws they couldn’t make it private, but since we were 10 people, it wouldn’t be an issue.</p>
<div class="imgwrapper" style=""><div><a href="/mainevent3/partay3_2.jpg" class="fancy"><img src="/mainevent3/partay3_2.jpg" style="max-height: 250px"/></a></div></div>

<p>The game was $1/2 NL. It was an absolutely crazy game. There were straddling everywhere, all ins in the dark, pot sweetening and delicious suckouts.</p>
<div class="imgwrapper" style=""><div><a href="/mainevent3/partay4_2.jpg" class="fancy"><img src="/mainevent3/partay4_2.jpg" style="max-height: 250px"/></a></div></div>

<p>I started out by being stuck $600 within 30 minutes. Then started the most incredible run I’ve ever experienced. I flopped sets everywhere, rivered quads, flopped two pair with my 52o (which I ofcourse had to limp with in MP no matter any amount of raises) and so forth. In about an hour I built my stack up to around $1500 (and we’re still talking about a $1/2 NL, $200 max buyin game).</p>
<div class="imgwrapper" style=""><div><a href="/mainevent3/partay5_2.jpg" class="fancy"><img src="/mainevent3/partay5_2.jpg" style="max-height: 250px"/></a></div></div>

<p>Without boring you, I’ll just say that in the next couple of hours I managed to dump away all of my stack (most of it to the creepy lucky luckbox Mikael) so I ended up being stuck $600 again.</p>
<p>After busting I went over to the bar where I found Morten and Rune totally wasted due to playing video poker and receiving free drinks.</p>
<div class="imgwrapper" style=""><div><a href="/mainevent3/partay12_2.jpg" class="fancy"><img src="/mainevent3/partay12_2.jpg" style="max-height: 250px"/></a></div></div>

<p>We all decided to head out to Spearmint Rhino. And you simply can’t drive out to the Spearmint in anything but a limo, se we walked over to Caesars Palace and got a limo.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the rest of the night belongs under the “What happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas” category…</p>

				<p>Today was a weird day. Yesterday was the day that the WSOP Day 2B was played. Since we (me and Rune - the only two left in the WSOP ME from the camp) both played on 2A, we had the day off. Today is the official WSOP ME break day before we start on the 5 day marathon beginning from tomorrow, friday, day 3.</p>

<div class="imgwrapper" style=""><div><a href="/relaxation/relax_2.jpg" class="fancy"><img src="/relaxation/relax_2.jpg" style="max-height: 250px"/></a></div></div>

<p>Neither of us wanted to do anything big today as it’s very important that we get our sleep and are ready for the big and long day tomorrow. I got up somewhere between 2 PM and 5 PM, don’t really remember when exactly. We ordered dinner through Dominos (absolutely excellent online ordering service!), so we didn’t have to leave the house at all.</p>
<p>I joined Rune into the Rio at about 11 PM since he needed to register for his ITIN number in the event that he cashes in the WSOP - which all odds are beginning to speak in favor of. Without an ITIN (Individual Taxpayer Identification Number) the USA will hold back 30% of your winnings to pay the american taxes. Being an alien you don’t have to pay these taxes, but if you have not registered for an ITIN number, you’re shit outta luck.</p>
<p>After being beat endlessly in pool (seriously, I suck at it) I decided to head for bed early tonight (1 AM). Tomorrow at noon, history will unfold!</p>

<div class="imgwrapper" style=""><div><a href="/mainevent2/day3_2.jpg" class="fancy"><img src="/mainevent2/day3_2.jpg" style="max-height: 250px"/></a></div></div>

<p>Before starting on day two, I made myself the promise that I would get a good nights sleep this time, last time I only got about four hours. So I went to bed at around 1 AM that night, falling asleep very quickly while watcing South Park episodes on my laptop. Perfect.</p>
<p>I woke up three hours later at 4 AM. Dammit, this is just not happening. Luckily I fell asleep again.</p>
<p>One hour later I woke up for good. I tried sleeping, but everytime I was close to sleeping, someone made a big roar from the living room in the house (there’s always somebody who’s awake in the camp). I have decided that if I make it through day three, I’m going to get myself a room at the Rio. After day three we will be playing every day until the 10th of august, so it’ll be important that I get some rest.</p>
<p>Before we started, I said to Morten (Abuello) that I was either going out of this day with $100k or with $0. This was my way of saying that I do not care if I bust out early. I don’t want to just fold my way through this tourney, just making it into the money. I’m going for the kill. I started out with $18.425, blinds being 250/500 + 50 ante.</p>
<p>Let me start out by saying that I do not take notes during my play, so remembering hands can be quite difficult. As so, many hands will just be vague memories though I will try to get the important factors in.</p>
<p>I certainly proved my statement since I was all in three times during the first five hands. First hand I get is <strong>KcQc</strong>, I raise it up in LP after a couple of limpers. I get a single caller. Flop comes an incidbly beautiful <strong>TcJs7c</strong> giving me not only the second nut flush draw, but also the open ended nut straight draw. I bet out around 3/4 of the pot, pretty hard. He calls. I can’t really remember the turn, but it’s a total blank like the <strong>5h</strong> or something like that. Now the opponent bets out, I think for about 10 seconds before I push it all in. He folds.</p>
<p>Next hand I get <strong>TsJs</strong> in LP. There’s about 6 limpers to me (who would’ve though this is a $10k buyin tournament?) so I limp. Flop comes something like <strong>Tc6sQs</strong>, pretty good. It’s checked all the way around. Turn comes with another spade, blank otherwise. IIRC, I bet, get raised, I push all in, he folds.</p>
<p>A couple of hands go by when I get a red pair of threes: <strong>3h3d</strong>. I raise it up from EMP, get a single caller in the blinds. Flop comes <strong>Kh2d7c</strong>. He bets out about 2/4 of the pot. Now I don’t know why, but my read (after only 4 hands previous to this one) and my instinct tells me that he is weak, so I call with the intention of making a move on him on the turn. The turn comes with the most beautiful card ever: <strong>3s</strong>. He instantly pushes… I instantly call and shows him the set of threes. He’s devastated as he turns over his AKo and realizes that he’s drawing dead. I rake in yet another nice pot. I get a nice start, being up to around 40k after a very short time period.</p>
<p>Today was the first time ever that I wore sunglasses during play. Up until now I’d been kinda sceptical about it, didn’t really think it’d make a difference. Boy was I wrong. Wearing the sunglasses made an enormous difference. I suddenly had the ability to look and stare at everybody at the table without them knowing. Also I recognized that nobody were able to stare me down as they otherwise could when I weren’t wearing the sunglasses. On the contrary I was much better at staring at them, probably because I subconsciously realized that they couldn’t look at me in the same way.</p>
<p>At one point I get a black pair of sevens: <strong>7s7c</strong> in LP. I raise it up. A new internet pro-ish guy sitting in seat one pushes his short stack of around 12k into the middle. Folded around to me. This player had been at my table for around 30 minutes, he’d made a lot of correct shortplay moves, pushing it in LP, pushing into weak preflop raises and such. All this made me pretty certain that he was a good player, and therefor I knew that he’d make this move on me with pretty much any pair, all aces, no matter the kicker, and a lot of hands like TJ, KJ and the likes. So I called with my sevens. I clearly announced ‘Call’ at the table, wherafter the dealer knocked in front of me, signalling for us to show our cards. I flipped my cards over, placing them in front of me, but still near me. As the other guy was turning over his cards, the dealer suddenly takes both my cards, flips them over and mucks them. The table broke out into an uproar. I had clearly announced CALL, and several people at the table confirmed this, even those at the other end of the table. I called my hand, black sevens, and so did about three other people at the table that had clearly seen my hand when I flipped it over. Now some guy to my right starts talking about it being a dead hand as it had touched the muck - which is the correct ruling albeit extremely unfair to me as this was 100% a dealer error. Luckily he didn’t really force it through, and while the dealer looked kinda embarrased (although he at no point excused to me), he started wading through the mucked cards to find my black sevens. While he looked for my sevens, he also showed up a red seven, removing one of my outs. The dealer finally found my cards and placed them on the table, signalling to the other guy that he should flip over his cards (he seemed afraid to do so, with good reason). He flipped over AKo, a classical coinflip. Flop + turn were blanks, unfortunately the river ace gave him the winning hand and he won a nice pot of around 25k.</p>
<p>There can and should be no doubt that I were extremely lucky when I drew my table on the end of day 1A. The table consisted purely of no-names, and there were not a single player that I really feared. Most of them played ABC poker, and most were a bit too weak for their own good. I’ll try to explain a couple of the key persons at the table.</p>
<p>To my left was sitting an old gentleman, I’d guess he was around 65 - I didn’t ask. He was a great player to have at the table. Besides him being a really friendly guy, he was playing very usual tight ABC poker - very common to the elder generations of players in my experience so far.</p>
<p>To my right were an OK guy, he played his hands too weak, was very easy to run over during hands and so forth - most of the players at the table were exactly like this guy.</p>
<p>Further to my right was a shortstacked guy (he was the one that mumbled about the dead hand rule), he probably had around 15k when he entered today. At no point did he have more than 20k. He ended the day with around 9k. I have no idea of how he did it, but somehow he survived more than 15 all ins. He played extremely tight for a short stack, definitely not the correct shortstack strategy. As an example, one guy in EP limps, shortstack limps, and the guy to my direct right limps also. I look down at <strong>Js2h</strong> and raise it up to 5k (blinds 600/1200 + 100) to take down the pot. Everybody folds. I later find out that the shortstack guy had <strong>AdTd</strong> - he didn’t raise (easy push being a shortstack), and even worse, he folded to my raise. The guy to my direct right folded AJ. This both shows how awful several of these main event players are, as well as how much respect I got from the table.</p>
<p>At the other end of the table sat a played that I really got irritated with. I don’t know if he’s just slow in general, really inexperienced at live poker or if he was just trying to be a bitch on purpose. He was constantly taking a long time to make his decisions. There could be 5 limpers to him preflop, then he’d take a minute to ponder over his hand, and then he’d fold. I mean, come on, how frigging hard can it be? Also, in one hand, he’d just won a big hand in the previous hand with AA (this guy got AA 7 times during the hand, they all held up) so he was stacking his chips. The action got around to him, and he didn’t follow the action so it was like 10-15 seconds before he realized that the whole table was looking at him, waiting for him to make a decision. “Oh, it’s on me?”. He looked at his cards, put them down again, and then he kept stacking his chips. The dealer knocked in front of him to kinda signal that we were still waiting for him. He looked at his cards again, and blimey if he didn’t make a few corrections to his chipstack at that moment, correcting a couple of edges here and there. And THEN he folded his hands as if it was 72o - which it could’ve easily been.</p>
<p>At our lunch break I ate at the All American grill in the Rio together with Rune who was also still in. By coinscidence I sat next to this slow guy from my own table. We got into a short conversation and I found out he was russian. He had this terrible american way of speaking - with russian accent. Everytime he met someone new he started out with “Hey man”, “Oh man”, “Man, “ argh, stop it!</p>
<p>I have the deepest respect of good players having a large stack, Jason Strasser for instance, he really deserves it. This russian guy also had a large stack, but it was not due to his play. He played pretty loose, but not the good loose aggresive style, just plain loose passive. He was pretty easy to push around though. He’d received AA 7 times during the day (I have yet to see AA during the whole main event <em>hint</em> day three dealers! <em>/hint</em>), and all the times he got doubled up.</p>
<p>Near the end of the day I got <strong>JdQd</strong> in EP. I raised it up to 4k as was becoming common to my style (though everyone still respected me and treated me as a very TAG’ish player). The russian was the sole caller. Flop come <strong>Ad9s7c</strong> - or something similar. I bet 5k on the flop (pot around 12k) - this was the normal bet sizes, remember that 2k came from the antes alone. He thought for about 10 seconds and then called. The turn was a total blank, probably the <strong>3c</strong>. I bet out 9k this time. He though for probably 30 seconds, I could easily see that he really did not like this, but he ended up calling nevertheless. The river brought the last and final blank, a<strong> 5h</strong> (or similar). Now, I didn’t like having invested this much in the pot, beating nothing but lesser air then I had, but still, if I checked, I’d loose the pot for sure. My only option was to bet out (I was pretty sure I could push him out also), so I pushed in 15k. During the 5-10 minutes he used to think of the hand, several times he held his cards in a position as if he was going to fold - not looking for reads as he was clearly not looking at me (he was looking into the air in a surrendering way). Yet he ended up calling… With <strong>As2d</strong>. My god, the whole table suddenly lived up. One thing was that I had to show my pure bluff, but what really made the table “Oh my god” was his hand, A2o! Now, a couple of the less good players gave him the standard “Nice call” while most others were padding my back saying I made a good play, while being totally non understanding of his call. How did he call my 4k bet preflop with A2o? He’d be dominated in most cases, I was raising from EP. I bet out strong during all streets, there was no way he could put me on anything but AK/AQ/set. I wouldn’t have bet an underpair this way the whole way. Before contemplating if he just really had a good read on me and he made a superb play… Trust me, this guy was not the type to utilize reads.</p>
<p>Oh well, that crazy russian hand brought me down to around 70k with only 30 minutes to go. Dammit, I was up to 120k shortly before, if I’d won that hand, I’d be around 160-170k.</p>
<p>Just before ending the day, I got <strong>6h6d</strong> in the MP. I raised it up, an anonymous (playing <em>extremely</em> tight the couple of hours he’d been at the table) bigstack called as the only caller. The flop was kinda good, though a bit scary: <strong>6cTc7d</strong>. I made the standard bet of 5k. He called pretty quickly. The turn brought a <strong>Qh</strong>, I bet 8k, again he called rather quickly. Now, I was starting to fear if he was holding 89 since he was calling that quickly. The river brought the case <strong>6s</strong>, now all of my straight fears were gone, I had quads! I bet out 10k, and again he called rather quickly. He looked pretty stunned to see my quads. I don’t think he had the straight any more, he probably had the ten, maybe some kind of TJ combination. After all he had just seen my JQs bluff shortly before.</p>
<p>This last hand brought me up to ~$95.400 which I think is close enough to my projected goal of $100k to be satisfying. The average is around $76k so I’m well above average. The play will commence on friday at noon, day 3. When I make it through day three also, I’m going to rent a room at the Rio so I’ll be able to get my sleep - it will without doubt be necessary.</p>
<p>Again this friday I’ve drawn a pretty good table for me:</p>
<ul>
<li>1 Marius Sorensen $35,800  </li>
<li>2 David Pham $112,300  </li>
<li>3 Jim McCrink $88,100  </li>
<li>4 Mark Rasmussen $95,400  </li>
<li>5 George Watson $24,100  </li>
<li>6 David Hony $54,400  </li>
<li>7 Bo Sehlstedt $65,400  </li>
<li>8 Paul Kitsos $50,400  </li>
<li>9 Martin Virgen $197,500  </li>
<li>10 Jon Nakatani $23,000  </li>
<li>Average $74,640</li>
</ul>
<p>I’m sitting together with a fellow dane, Marius Sørensen. To the first four places on my right I’ve got semi-shortstacks, including one real shortstack of only 24k. All your blinds are belong to me! There are only two players with stacks larger than mine, Martin Virgen which seems to play mostly low limit events - he won his ME entry through a live super satellite. David Pham on the other hands is probably one to watch out for.</p>

				<p>Today I got up relatively early at about 1 PM. Before I knew of it, it had somehow become 7 PM, and several of us were starting to become quite hungry. We weren’t really in the mood for the usual fast food, and neither of use were turned on by the local sushi bar. Instead we went a couple hundred meters down Eastern Avenue to a local placed called ‘The T-Bird’. The scenery was a classical 60’s highway truckerstop place. It was kinda sad as it really looked like it was stuck in the 60’s.</p>

<p>When our waitress (very hot youngish blonde) came to take our orders, Morten wanted to order onion rings as a side dish, as well as french fries for his main order. There were some confusion as to whether he could do as he wanted, so this little conversation took place:</p>
<p>Morten: “Can I do that?”<br>Her: “You can have whatever you want”</p>
<p>Now Morten slowly looked at hear from top to bottom, slightly pausing on the breast area, whereafter he muttered a slowrolled “Okaaaay”. I guess you should’ve been there, we all cracked up for sure… I’m not sure if she got the “joke”.</p>
<p>When we got back we decided to go to our local casino / resort, the Green Valley Ranch. Just before we were about to lave, I got an SMS from my cousin Dennis. Dennis and a couple of his friends were in Vegas also, and he was asking if we could meet up tonight. Despite some communicational problems we managed to find each other outside the Circus Circus (I used about 10 minutes just looking for the Strip exit from that place… God I hate Circus Circus.</p>

<p>As Dennis and his friends were all below 21, we couldn’t drink or anything, so we decided to go for a stripwalk instead, seeing some of the most fascinating strip hotels.</p>
<p>The without doubt most fascinating hotel I have seen thus far is the Venetian. The way they have recreated the Venetian canals, gondolas, the sky, walkways and everything is nothing but amazing.</p>

<p>After the Venetian we went to Bally’s / Paris to see the recreation of Paris and the Eiffel Tower.</p>

<p>After taking a trip by the Rio and the Luxor we split up as it was nearing 3 AM, Dennis and his friends were headed back towards LA at 11 AM that very next morning.</p>

<p>After arriving back home at the camp, I and a couple of other guys that were awake watched some mexian/hispanic tv show that we understood absolutely nothing of, but it contained an overload of totally hot chicks, so we didn’t really mind not understanding what they said.</p>

				<p>… happened today. I got up early (around 2 PM) as I really needed to be able to go to bed early tonight. Tomorrow is the second day of the WSOP Main Event tournament. They’re expected the day to last around 15 hours like the first day, so I will need to be well rested, unlike on day one.</p>

<p>I went to the New York New York tonight for a dinner party arranged on the 2+2 forums. We met up at the ESPN Zone and got a couple of beers, some above average fast food and then we split up again.</p>
<p>I bought myself a nifty little camera today (Sony DSC-W50) today that is small enough for me to fit it in my pocket. This means I’ll be able to take a lot more of pictures during the day as my main camera (Sony DSC-R1) is a bit too large to bring into the Spearmint and such places.</p>
<p>I’m off to bed now (1 AM). We’re taking a cab to the Rio tomorrow at around 10 AM, hoping to be able to get some breakfast in there before the crowd starts moving in.</p>
