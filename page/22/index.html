				<p>Upgrading to IIS 7 should be rather transparent, unfortunately that is not the case when it comes to URL rewriting as we knew it from IIS 6. In IIS 6 all we had to do was to add a wildcard mapping making sure that all requests went through the ASPNET ISAPI process. After this was done, one could create a global.asax file that would either pass requests directly through or rewrite the URL based on an internal algorithm.</p>
<a id="more"></a>

<p><strong>UPDATE: Please see my <a href="/how-to-do-url-rewriting-on-iis-7-properly">updated post</a> on how to do proper URL rewriting using IIS 7.</strong></p>
<p>I didn’t really expect this to be a problem when I first requested <a href="http://localhost" target="_blank">http://localhost</a> for the first time after setting up my site on IIS 7 (all default settings).</p>
<div class="imgwrapper" style=""><div><a href="/making-url-rewriting-on-iis7-work-like-iis6/iis7ur1_2.jpg" class="fancy"><img src="/making-url-rewriting-on-iis7-work-like-iis6/iis7ur1_2.jpg" style="max-height: 250px"/></a></div></div>

<p>Unfortunately this was what I was presented with. Anyone having worked with wildcard mappings from IIS 6 will recognize this, this is the result you’ll get after adding a wildcard mapping without having created your URL rewriting functionality. After adding a wildcard map the IIS will not automatically find a default file (by design).</p>
<p>This however, is not the problem cause here. I already have my URL rewriting functionality written in my global.asax BeginRequest method and I’d really like to just reuse my current code. Although the new IIS has a whole new bunch of features - one of them being a new “more correct” way of doing URL rewriting -, I really just wan’t to get my website up and running again so I can continue my work.</p>
<p>What I present below is a quick’n’dirty hack that will get my old URL rewriting code to work again. It may not be the IIS 7 way of doing it, and it may not work in your case, it depends on the type of URL mapping you’re doing in your project. In short, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Your_mileage_may_vary" target="_blank">YMMV</a>.</p>
<h2 id="My_scenario">My scenario</h2>
<p>For this website, improve.dk, all URL’s except static files are requested as though they were folders. That means you will not see any pages ending in anything but a /. Any static files are requested as usual. That means I can be sure that a regular expression like <em>.</em> will catch all static files, while * will catch all pages - as well as the static files!</p>
<h2 id="How_I_got_URL_rewriting_to_work_like_IIS_6">How I got URL rewriting to work like IIS 6</h2>
<p>Start by opening the IIS Manager and selecting your website.</p>
<div class="imgwrapper" style=""><div><a href="/making-url-rewriting-on-iis7-work-like-iis6/iis7ur2_2.jpg" class="fancy"><img src="/making-url-rewriting-on-iis7-work-like-iis6/iis7ur2_2.jpg" style="max-height: 250px"/></a></div></div>

<p>Now enter the “Handler Mappings” section:</p>
<div class="imgwrapper" style=""><div><a href="/making-url-rewriting-on-iis7-work-like-iis6/iis7ur3_2.jpg" class="fancy"><img src="/making-url-rewriting-on-iis7-work-like-iis6/iis7ur3_2.jpg" style="max-height: 250px"/></a></div></div>

<p>Notice the “StaticFile” handler. Currently it’s set to match <em> and catch both File and Directory requests. If you look back at the first image, you’ll notice that the error message details that the handler causing the 404 error is the StaticFile handler. As I know that all my static files will have a file extension (also I don’t care for directory browsing), I’ll simply change my StaticFile handler so it only matches </em>.* - and only files.</p>
<div class="imgwrapper" style=""><div><a href="/making-url-rewriting-on-iis7-work-like-iis6/iis7ur4_2.jpg" class="fancy"><img src="/making-url-rewriting-on-iis7-work-like-iis6/iis7ur4_2.jpg" style="max-height: 250px"/></a></div></div>

<div class="imgwrapper" style=""><div><a href="/making-url-rewriting-on-iis7-work-like-iis6/iis7ur5_2.jpg" class="fancy"><img src="/making-url-rewriting-on-iis7-work-like-iis6/iis7ur5_2.jpg" style="max-height: 250px"/></a></div></div>

<p>Your StaticFile handler should now look like this:</p>
<div class="imgwrapper" style=""><div><a href="/making-url-rewriting-on-iis7-work-like-iis6/iis7ur6_2.jpg" class="fancy"><img src="/making-url-rewriting-on-iis7-work-like-iis6/iis7ur6_2.jpg" style="max-height: 250px"/></a></div></div>

<p>Now, if you go back and make a request to <a href="http://localhost" target="_blank">http://localhost</a> you’ll still get the 404 error, but this time the request is not handled by the StaticFile handler, actually it doesn’t get handled by any handler at all:</p>
<div class="imgwrapper" style=""><div><a href="/making-url-rewriting-on-iis7-work-like-iis6/iis7ur7_2.jpg" class="fancy"><img src="/making-url-rewriting-on-iis7-work-like-iis6/iis7ur7_2.jpg" style="max-height: 250px"/></a></div></div>

<p>What needs to be done now is that we need to map any and all requests to the aspnet_isapi.dll isapi file - just like we would usually do in IIS 6.</p>
<p>Add a new Script Map to the list of Handler Mappings and set it up like this:</p>
<div class="imgwrapper" style=""><div><a href="/making-url-rewriting-on-iis7-work-like-iis6/iis7ur8_2.jpg" class="fancy"><img src="/making-url-rewriting-on-iis7-work-like-iis6/iis7ur8_2.jpg" style="max-height: 250px"/></a></div></div>

<div class="imgwrapper" style=""><div><a href="/making-url-rewriting-on-iis7-work-like-iis6/iis7ur9_2.jpg" class="fancy"><img src="/making-url-rewriting-on-iis7-work-like-iis6/iis7ur9_2.jpg" style="max-height: 250px"/></a></div></div>

<p>Click OK and click <em>Yes</em> at the confirmation dialog:</p>
<div class="imgwrapper" style=""><div><a href="/making-url-rewriting-on-iis7-work-like-iis6/iis7ur10_2.jpg" class="fancy"><img src="/making-url-rewriting-on-iis7-work-like-iis6/iis7ur10_2.jpg" style="max-height: 250px"/></a></div></div>

<p>Now if you make a request to either <a href="http://localhost" target="_blank">http://localhost</a> or any other file you’ll get the following error:</p>
<div class="imgwrapper" style=""><div><a href="/making-url-rewriting-on-iis7-work-like-iis6/iis7ur11_2.jpg" class="fancy"><img src="/making-url-rewriting-on-iis7-work-like-iis6/iis7ur11_2.jpg" style="max-height: 250px"/></a></div></div>

<p>Looking throug the Event log reveals the cause of the error:</p>
<div class="imgwrapper" style=""><div><a href="/making-url-rewriting-on-iis7-work-like-iis6/iis7ur12_2.jpg" class="fancy"><img src="/making-url-rewriting-on-iis7-work-like-iis6/iis7ur12_2.jpg" style="max-height: 250px"/></a></div></div>

<p>The aspnet_isapi.dll file cannot be used as a Handler for websites running in the new IIS 7 Integrated Mode, thus we will need to make our website run in classic .NET mode. Right click your website node in the IIS Manager and select Advanced Settings. Select the “Classic .NET AppPool” and close the dialog boxes:</p>
<div class="imgwrapper" style=""><div><a href="/making-url-rewriting-on-iis7-work-like-iis6/iis7ur13_2.jpg" class="fancy"><img src="/making-url-rewriting-on-iis7-work-like-iis6/iis7ur13_2.jpg" style="max-height: 250px"/></a></div></div>

<p>Now you should be able to make a request to <a href="http://localhost" target="_blank">http://localhost</a> and see it work. Your URL rewriting should work as a charm aswell:</p>
<div class="imgwrapper" style=""><div><a href="/making-url-rewriting-on-iis7-work-like-iis6/iis7ur14_2.jpg" class="fancy"><img src="/making-url-rewriting-on-iis7-work-like-iis6/iis7ur14_2.jpg" style="max-height: 250px"/></a></div></div>

<p>But obviously somethings wrong. Making a request to any static file will reveal the problem:</p>
<div class="imgwrapper" style=""><div><a href="/making-url-rewriting-on-iis7-work-like-iis6/iis7ur15_2.jpg" class="fancy"><img src="/making-url-rewriting-on-iis7-work-like-iis6/iis7ur15_2.jpg" style="max-height: 250px"/></a></div></div>

<p>“Failed to Execute URL”, what a great descriptive error. Fortunately you won’t have to spend hours ripping out hair… As I have already done that - at least I’ll save a trip or two to the barber.</p>
<p>The problem is that the static files are being processed by the aspnet_isapi.dll file instead of simply sending the request along to the StaticFile handler. If you click the “View Ordered List…” link in the IIS Manager from the Handler Mappings view, you’ll see the order in which the handlers are being executed for each request:</p>
<div class="imgwrapper" style=""><div><a href="/making-url-rewriting-on-iis7-work-like-iis6/iis7ur16_2.jpg" class="fancy"><img src="/making-url-rewriting-on-iis7-work-like-iis6/iis7ur16_2.jpg" style="max-height: 250px"/></a></div></div>

<p>When you add a new Script Map it’ll automatically get placed at the very top of the line taking precedence over any other handlers, including the StaticFile one.</p>
<p>What we have to do is to move our Wildcard handler to the very bottom, below the StaticFile handler. By letting the StaticFile handler have precedence over our Wildcard handler we ensure that any static files (matching <em>.</em>) gets processed correctly while any other URL’s gets passed along to our own Wildcard handler that’ll do the URL rewriting and make business work as usual:</p>
<div class="imgwrapper" style=""><div><a href="/making-url-rewriting-on-iis7-work-like-iis6/iis7ur17_2.jpg" class="fancy"><img src="/making-url-rewriting-on-iis7-work-like-iis6/iis7ur17_2.jpg" style="max-height: 250px"/></a></div></div>

<p>After doing so, both static files as well as your custom URL’s should execute as they would under IIS 6:</p>
<div class="imgwrapper" style=""><div><a href="/making-url-rewriting-on-iis7-work-like-iis6/iis7ur18_2.jpg" class="fancy"><img src="/making-url-rewriting-on-iis7-work-like-iis6/iis7ur18_2.jpg" style="max-height: 250px"/></a></div></div>

<h2 id="Disclaimer">Disclaimer</h2>
<p>Please notice that this is a hack. This is not the way URL rewriting is supposed to be done under IIS 7. But instead of spending hours upon hours investigating how to do it the right way, this is quick fix to make things work like they did before.</p>
<p>Also please note that this solution is intended to work for my specific situation. Your needs for URL rewriting may not necessarily match mine, so you may have to modify certain settings to suit your specific needs.</p>

				<p>In an effort to get my HTC TyTN Windows Mobile 5 based PDA to synchronize with my Vista system, I downloaded the newest release of ActiveSync (4.2). This is what happens when you try to install ActiveSync on Vista:</p>
<a id="more"></a>

<div class="imgwrapper" style=""><div><a href="/missing-windows-mobile-device-center/wmdc5_2.jpg" class="fancy"><img src="/missing-windows-mobile-device-center/wmdc5_2.jpg" style="max-height: 250px"/></a></div></div>

<p>After searching for a solution it became apparent that Vista was born with the successor of ActiveSync, namely the Windows Mobile Device Center (WMDC in short, which is not to be mistaken for the Weapons of Mass Destruction Commission, which shares the same acronym).</p>
<div class="imgwrapper" style=""><div><a href="/missing-windows-mobile-device-center/wmdc6_2.jpg" class="fancy"><img src="/missing-windows-mobile-device-center/wmdc6_2.jpg" style="max-height: 250px"/></a></div></div>

<p>And whadda ya know, there it is, Windows Mobile Device Center. It really does come preinstalled, neat.</p>
<div class="imgwrapper" style=""><div><a href="/missing-windows-mobile-device-center/wmdc1_2.jpg" class="fancy"><img src="/missing-windows-mobile-device-center/wmdc1_2.jpg" style="max-height: 250px"/></a></div></div>

<p>But… If it’s pre installed, why is this all I get when I run the WMDC? Apparently it’s perfectly able to recognize that my device is connected.</p>
<div class="imgwrapper" style=""><div><a href="/missing-windows-mobile-device-center/wmdc3_2.jpg" class="fancy"><img src="/missing-windows-mobile-device-center/wmdc3_2.jpg" style="max-height: 250px"/></a></div></div>

<p>And furthermore it’s also able to recognize the name of the device, as well as the operating system, PPC 5.1 / Windows Mobile 5. But why is it not able to synchronize then?</p>
<p>For some reason the Windows Mobile Device Center is NOT preinstalled after all, or at least the actual Device Center isn’t, only the connectivity parts are. To use the Windows Mobile Device Center you’ll have to <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=C23C8E6A-A72D-4AEF-9663-31CE2FEFBADA&amp;displaylang=en" target="_blank">download the Beta 3 version of WMDC</a> and install it.</p>
<div class="imgwrapper" style=""><div><a href="/missing-windows-mobile-device-center/wmdc2_2.jpg" class="fancy"><img src="/missing-windows-mobile-device-center/wmdc2_2.jpg" style="max-height: 250px"/></a></div></div>

<p>After installing the Beta 3 version of WMDC it runs perfectly. It really seems to be a lot more snappy and intuitive than the old ActiveSync.</p>

				<p>Ok, so I’d promised myself that I would at least give it a month before I’d install Vista on my desktop computer as I simply will not be able to cope with having major problems here. For work purposes I simply have to have a functional desktop computer.</p>
<a id="more"></a>

<p>Oh to heck with that! Having tried Vista on my laptop, I craved for seeing it expose it’s full potential on a more capable machine. I fell into the pressure. I did it. I installed Vista on my desktop.</p>
<p>I’ve blogged the whole process, moving from the usual XP environment to Vista, all the new features, annoyances, problems and so forth. I won’t be blogging about all of it as there’s simply too much, instead I’ll be releasing an article shortly describing the whole process. For now, I’ll stick to a problem I had when I tried to install Office 2007 on the newly installed Vista machine (a problem which Google couldn’t remedy). It was an absolutely fresh install on a formatted drive, all that I’d installed so far were some device drivers. Barring this, Office 2007 should install without a hitch right? Guess not.</p>
<div class="imgwrapper" style=""><div><a href="/installing-office-2007-on-vista/officeinstall_1_2.jpg" class="fancy"><img src="/installing-office-2007-on-vista/officeinstall_1_2.jpg" style="max-height: 250px"/></a></div></div>

<p>I started the installation without problems, chose my setup configuration and began the actual installation. After about 6-7 minutes it was at the end of the installation according to the process bar. An hour later it was still at the end of the process bar without anything visibly happening. I checked the task manager, it was constantly using 10-15% CPU. I gave it another hour as I had to go eat anyways.</p>
<div class="imgwrapper" style=""><div><a href="/installing-office-2007-on-vista/officeinstall_2_2.jpg" class="fancy"><img src="/installing-office-2007-on-vista/officeinstall_2_2.jpg" style="max-height: 250px"/></a></div></div>

<p>After the second hour it had still not moved anywhere, I’d guess you can call it dead by now. I cancelled the setup (by clicking the red X), but this time it hung again, halfways in the uninstall. Half an hour later I killed the process as nothing was happening.</p>
<div class="imgwrapper" style=""><div><a href="/installing-office-2007-on-vista/officeinstall_3_2.jpg" class="fancy"><img src="/installing-office-2007-on-vista/officeinstall_3_2.jpg" style="max-height: 250px"/></a></div></div>

<p>Then this friendly fella popped up, teling me that the uninstallation probably didn’t go as planned, well woope de doo. Clicking “Uninstall using recommended settings” performed the uninstall without problems (I seriously wonder what the “recommended” settings are, seeing as there are no settings in regards of an uninstall).</p>
<div class="imgwrapper" style=""><div><a href="/installing-office-2007-on-vista/officeinstall_4_2.jpg" class="fancy"><img src="/installing-office-2007-on-vista/officeinstall_4_2.jpg" style="max-height: 250px"/></a></div></div>

<p>Reinitiating the Office 2007 install from the DVD resulted in this error - it gets more and more cryptic. I have sucessfully used this DVD to install Vista on Windows XP without problems, so it can’t be the DVD. I then resorted to the true swizz army knife of any software developer - a reboot.</p>
<p>After rebooting I initiated the install again, and what do you know, it actually went all the way through this time without any problems. Finally! Or so I thought at least.</p>
<div class="imgwrapper" style=""><div><a href="/installing-office-2007-on-vista/officeinstall_5_2.jpg" class="fancy"><img src="/installing-office-2007-on-vista/officeinstall_5_2.jpg" style="max-height: 250px"/></a></div></div>

<p>“Failed to register a VB Script DLL. Reinstall or run Regsvr32.exe Vbscript.dll to self register. ‘C:Program FilesMicrosoft OfficeOffice12FORMS1033scdrestl.ico’ is not a valid icon file.”</p>
<p>When starting up Outlook, I receive this error message (during the “Setting up accounts” initialization phase). Clicking OK (or the red X) resulted in Outlook closing down and me receiving yet another almost identical message:</p>
<div class="imgwrapper" style=""><div><a href="/installing-office-2007-on-vista/officeinstall_6_2.jpg" class="fancy"><img src="/installing-office-2007-on-vista/officeinstall_6_2.jpg" style="max-height: 250px"/></a></div></div>

<p>“‘C:Program FilesMicrosoft OfficeOffice12FORMS1033scdrestl.ico’ is not a valid icon file.”</p>
<p>More or less the same error message, though this time the title of the dialog was “SetPoint” - the mouse/keyboard driver software for my Logitech diNovo keyboard - what the fudge?</p>
<div class="imgwrapper" style=""><div><a href="/installing-office-2007-on-vista/officeinstall_7_2.jpg" class="fancy"><img src="/installing-office-2007-on-vista/officeinstall_7_2.jpg" style="max-height: 250px"/></a></div></div>

<p>OK, it told me to either “self register” or uninstall. As I have no idea what “self register” incorporates (I tried to regsvr32 Vbscript.dll to no avail, and I hardly think a .ico file can be regsvr32’ed), I went for the uninstall. But this all to familiar dialog box popped up. After about five reboots and several torn images of Bill Gates I realized the I was not going to get this bugger uninstalled (this dialog also appeared through the “Programs and Features” control panel when trying to uninstall from there). So what’s the next step?</p>
<div class="imgwrapper" style=""><div><a href="/installing-office-2007-on-vista/officeinstall_8_2.jpg" class="fancy"><img src="/installing-office-2007-on-vista/officeinstall_8_2.jpg" style="max-height: 250px"/></a></div></div>

<p>Please do not ask me how, I really can’t remember how I dug myself in here, the important thing is that I did. I tried running both .MSI files. I have no idea what they did, the just executed with no GUI and then closed again in about one second. After running these MSI’s, I was suddenly able to run the Office installer again. It acted as though Office wasn’t even installed on my system so I couldn’t uninstall. I decided to just do an install again, hopefully overwriting any buggy files that might have caused the problem.</p>
<div class="imgwrapper" style=""><div><a href="/installing-office-2007-on-vista/officeinstall_5_21.jpg" class="fancy"><img src="/installing-office-2007-on-vista/officeinstall_5_21.jpg" style="max-height: 250px"/></a></div></div>

<p>Well, the good news is that the install went through problem free. The bad news is that the main problem persisted.</p>
<div class="imgwrapper" style=""><div><a href="/installing-office-2007-on-vista/officeinstall_9_21.jpg" class="fancy"><img src="/installing-office-2007-on-vista/officeinstall_9_21.jpg" style="max-height: 250px"/></a></div></div>

<p>I dug out the 2KB .ICO file that seemingly was corrupt (and was able to bring down Microsoft Outlook 2007 - talk about David vs. Goliath!). Windows Photo Gallery (the Vista pendant of the XP Preview application) wasn’t able to display the ICO file. As it was able to display all of the other .ICO’s in the same folder I think it’s safe to conclude that the file was somehow damaged.</p>

<p>Then I took the damaged SCDRESTL.ICO file and prepended the file name with an underscore. Afterwards I simply took a copy of one of the other working .ICO files (SCDRESTS.ICO) and renamed it SCDRESTL.ICO.</p>

				<p>It seems Logitech has some pretty functional SetPoint drivers out for Vista already (SetPoint is the all-purpose driver software for all their keyboards and mice).</p>
<a id="more"></a>

<p>The ony thing that did not work was the volume control. I could turn it up and down and the visual volume meter would respond (the SetPoint generated one, not the Vista one), but nothing would actually happen.</p>
<p>Fortunately there’s an easy solution.</p>

<p>Navigate to “C:Program FilesLogitechSetPoint”. Now make sure that the “SetPoint.exe” process is NOT running - you may have to click Ctrl+Shift+Escape and end the process in the task manager.</p>
<div class="imgwrapper" style=""><div><a href="/setpoint-volume-control-in-vista/setpoint_2_2.jpg" class="fancy"><img src="/setpoint-volume-control-in-vista/setpoint_2_2.jpg" style="max-height: 250px"/></a></div></div>

<p>Now rightclick SetPoint.exe and select “Properties”. Navigate to the Compatibility pane and set it to run in compatibility mode as Windows XP (Service Pack 2). After this, double click SetPoint.exe to restart the process. Your volume control should now work!</p>

				<p>Ever since IE7 came out developers have had the problem of whether they should upgrade or not. If they chose to upgrade, they wouldn’t be able to test their sites in IE6 any longer as installing IE7 would uninstall IE6. There are 3rd party hacks that allow both versions to be installed at the same time, but they will not simulate a true IE6 / IE7 environment.</p>
<a id="more"></a>

<p>In recognition of this problem, Microsoft has put out a free Virtual PC 2004 (VPC itself has also been made a free download) image containing a pre-activated Windows XP SP2 installation as well as IE6 and the IE7 readiness toolkit. The image will self destruct on the 1st of april 2007, there’ll probably be another solution out by then.</p>

				<p>I am now officially running Vista! Although I have been somewhat skeptical about Vista so far, I must admit that my first impression of Vista is quite positive.</p>
<a id="more"></a>

<p>It seems that most Microsoft affiliated Vista users brag about their high System Rating scores, most of them being in the 4+ area. How about aiming at who can get the lowest score? Well say hello to my laptop:</p>
<div class="imgwrapper" style=""><div><a href="/running-vista-and-msdnaa-update/vista_exp_index_2.jpg" class="fancy"><img src="/running-vista-and-msdnaa-update/vista_exp_index_2.jpg" style="max-height: 250px"/></a></div></div>

<div class="imgwrapper" style=""><div><a href="/running-vista-and-msdnaa-update/vista_exp_index_2.jpg" class="fancy"><img src="/running-vista-and-msdnaa-update/vista_exp_index_2.jpg" style="max-height: 250px"/></a></div></div>

<p>I’ve installed Vista on my Dell Latitude X1 laptop that boasts a puny 1.1Ghz Pentium M CPU and 512MB memory, and the graphics card isn’t even worth mentioning. To my surprise Vista actually seems to run quite well on my laptop. Naturally I’m unable to run the Aero user interface as my laptop is no where capable of that, but even the non-aero user interface looks quite neat. Another plus is that Vista was able to use my sound card, wifi, bluetooth and my laptop specific function keys without me installing any drivers, very nice (in a Borat-ish voice).</p>
<p>The Windows XP user interface never turned me on. In fact, the first thing I do on a new XP installation (after unplugging the network cable) is to revert the user interface back to the good old classic Windows 2000 look, ahhh, the memories. Although Vístas interface looks a lot more professional, one does get the feeling that it really is nothing more than a new user interface running on top of all the old components.</p>
<div class="imgwrapper" style=""><div><a href="/running-vista-and-msdnaa-update/vista_cmd_2.jpg" class="fancy"><img src="/running-vista-and-msdnaa-update/vista_cmd_2.jpg" style="max-height: 250px"/></a></div></div>

<p>For instance, look at this command prompt that I’ve opened. It clearly shows that the Vista interface attempts to put a Vista border around the classic 2k style window, creating some sort of ugly double-border look.</p>
<div class="imgwrapper" style=""><div><a href="/running-vista-and-msdnaa-update/vista_2kstyle_2.jpg" class="fancy"><img src="/running-vista-and-msdnaa-update/vista_2kstyle_2.jpg" style="max-height: 250px"/></a></div></div>

<p>If you switch back to the 2k look you get a bit disappointed. In my opinion the user interface looks very messy, there are no clear lines that indicate the various parts of the window. This isn’t just an issue with the “My Computer” window as indicated in the above picture, but in most Vista windows. Compare it to the Vista look below:</p>
<div class="imgwrapper" style=""><div><a href="/running-vista-and-msdnaa-update/vista_look2_2.jpg" class="fancy"><img src="/running-vista-and-msdnaa-update/vista_look2_2.jpg" style="max-height: 250px"/></a></div></div>

<p>Here the “Organize, views, system properties” line is clearly marked using a gradient color, giving a much cleaner look. I know it’s probably blasfemi, but I really wished that they’d spent a bit more time making a nice 2k look as well.</p>
<p>It’s sad that all I’m mentioning here is the user interface, but that really is what counts on a first impression basis. I haven’t used Vista more than about an hour, so I’m going to save any indepth analysis for later on when I know what I’m talking about.</p>
<h2 id="MSDNAA">MSDNAA</h2>
<p>It seems that Vista is already out on MSDNAA in some countries. Though there is no official date we’re hoping to have Vista out on MSDNAA in Denmark sometime in December. Vista Business will be available through MSDNAA, not Ultimate - the Media Center capabilities of Vista Ultimate includes some rather expensive codecs which cannot currently be put onto MSDNAA, I do however hope that it will be possible later on.</p>

				<p>As a developer I strive to increase my productivity. In contrast to most people I know, I’m able to multitask at an unusual level. I often sit at my desktop, working on several projects at the same time (literally), I may also watch multiple movies/tv-series at the same time and so forth.</p>
<a id="more"></a>

<p>So how do we increase productivity? I’ll stick with the hardware/software aspect and ignore the psychological issues (which are not to be neglected, the definitely play a big part as some people just seem to be unable to multitask at any level).</p>
<p>The one thing that has increased my productivity the most was when I bought my my dual-monitor setup (two 20” Dells). Having dual monitors is a world of difference in contrast to having just a single monitor, no matter the size of that single monitor. I’ve had several discussions with friends who would rather have a single 24” monitor instead of two 20” or two 17-19” (there’s no real difference between 17-19” monitors as they all support the same resolution). I would any day choose two low grade 17” monitors over a single 24” monitor, simply because ones productivity is a lot greater when having dual monitors. But why?</p>
<p>The problem with multi tasking on a single monitor is that we tend to - and Windows is built for - have our windows maximized. Maximizing windows is great, it saves us a lot of work, moving windows around so all the open windows fit, resizing them and so forth. By maximizing them we simply have to double click the titlebar and we’re done. But that’s not all good. The problem with maximizing windows is that we can only have a single active window at a time, requiring us to alt-tab around between the windows, or even worse, moving our mouse between the start menu and the actual window content area, wasting a lot of time.</p>
<p>Having multiple monitors enables you to have multiple maximized windows at the same time, as maximizing a window will only maximize it on the monitor it’s currently at. You’d be surprised at how often having just two maximized windows is all you need when working. As a developer we’ll usually have Visual Studio and Internet Explorer running (for web development), or possibly VS + SQL Server Management Studio and so forth. It also gives one a much better perception of the current work task as you can have a lot of arbitrary information lying around on the secondary monitor while working on the primary monitor.</p>
<p>Let me talk a bit about how to optimally place your monitors.</p>
<h2 id="Dual_monitor_setup">Dual monitor setup</h2>
<p>The most intuitive thing to do when setting up a dual monitor setup is to place both monitors on each side of the center point, in effect, placing you directly in between both monitors, having a great view on both of them.</p>
<div class="imgwrapper" style=""><div><a href="/multi-monitoring-with-style/monitorsetup_2.jpg" class="fancy"><img src="/multi-monitoring-with-style/monitorsetup_2.jpg" style="max-height: 250px"/></a></div></div>

<p>This however, is not optimal! You should place yourself directly in front of one of the monitors, the <em>primary</em> one. You will be concentrating your focus on just one of the monitors for 90% of the time, very very rarely will you need to actually look at both monitors at the same time. Placing yourself in the middle will (although you may not be consciously aware of it) cause you to twist your neck to one side continuously. By placing the primary monitor straight ahead of you, you can sit at a normal angle for most of the time, and it feels natural to look over on the other monitor when you actually need it.</p>
<h2 id="Quad_monitor_setup">Quad monitor setup</h2>
<p>What’s the next natural step after dual monitors? Quad monitors of course!</p>
<div class="imgwrapper" style=""><div><a href="/multi-monitoring-with-style/monitor_old_2.jpg" class="fancy"><img src="/multi-monitoring-with-style/monitor_old_2.jpg" style="max-height: 250px"/></a></div></div>

<p>This was my second setup, after my dual monitor setup. Let me give you a warning right now and here, you should <em>not</em> get a setup like this unless you have a really explicit need for quad monitors. I loved this setup while I was setting it up, I loved it for about a week (simply because I had to, after all it wasn’t really that cheap). But the fact is that it’s utterly useless. Again, you’ll have to position the primary monitor right in front of you, but on most quad monitor stands, it’s not really possible to customize the setup very much. Also the lower monitors will simply be too low for you to look at them naturally (and the top ones will be too high), so this setup will cause you to constantly sit in a bad position, not really having any monitors feeling natural to look at.</p>
<h2 id="Triple_monitor_setups">Triple monitor setups</h2>
<p>Before I had my quad setup, I had three of those 20” Dell’s. That was actually a quite good setup, and that’s what I’m going to describe here. Unfortunately you’ll have to do with a picture of my current setup (two 20”‘s with a center 30”) as I can’t find any pictures of my trip-20”‘s setup.</p>
<div class="imgwrapper" style=""><div><a href="/multi-monitoring-with-style/monitor_current1_2.jpg" class="fancy"><img src="/multi-monitoring-with-style/monitor_current1_2.jpg" style="max-height: 250px"/></a></div></div>

<p>Having three monitors is a great solution if you really need a lot of monitor real estate. The obvious advantage is that there’s a center monitor that will quite naturally become the primary monitor. The two side/satellite monitors will become secondary monitors where you’ll keep all the arbitrary info while working. Again, the most important factor here is that you’ll be able to work on your primary monitor while looking at a an angle that feels natural.</p>
<h2 id="Required_hardware">Required hardware</h2>
<p>Most people think it requires a lot of expensive hardware to run multiple monitors - that’s a myth! Most graphics cards today actually come with dual monitor outputs. It doesn’t matter if ones VGA and the other’s a DVI output, as long as you’re able to connect your monitors, it’ll work. If you’re going to buy a new graphics card, please do yourself a favor and get one with DVI outputs as it delivers a better picture on TFT’s.</p>
<p>As for monitors, you really should get yourself monitors that support the same height resolution. It’s a pain when you can’t move your mouse clearly from one monitor to the other since the resolution doesn’t allow you to do so.</p>
<h2 id="Software">Software</h2>
<p>Windows is great at automatically setting up your x-monitor system. It’ll automatically recognize the monitors and stretch your desktop across all monitors. You don’t need any 3rd party software to run multiple monitors.</p>
<div class="imgwrapper" style=""><div><a href="/multi-monitoring-with-style/monitorproperties_2.jpg" class="fancy"><img src="/multi-monitoring-with-style/monitorproperties_2.jpg" style="max-height: 250px"/></a></div></div>

<p>In the usual display properties control panel, you’ll be able to arrange your monitors and setup how they should behave when you move your mouse from one monitor to the other. If the physical left monitor appears to be on the right side of your center monitor, simply switch them around here.</p>
<p>You should note that there essentially three different multi monitor modes (I’ll be using nVidia terms as that’s what I’m using).</p>
<ul>
<li>DualView makes each monitor act as an individual monitor, that means you’ll be able to maximize windows on that monitor and make it behave as a stand alone monitor.</li>
<li>Clone does what the name implies, it simply clones the contents of your primary monitor onto your secondary monitor.</li>
<li>Horizontal span will combine all of your monitors to one giant monitor. It’s highly unusable as maximizing a window will cause it to be maximized across all monitors - which isn’t really that useful as you’ll probably have some space between the displays, causing an interruption in the middle of your favorite application.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="UltraMon">UltraMon</h2>
<p>While you don’t <em>need</em> any 3rd party software to run multiple monitors, you’re going to need some to do it effectively! When you connect multiple monitors to Windows, it’ll only show your taskbar on the primary monitor, and it’s a pain in the ass to move your mouse all the way from the secondary monitor to the primary monitor, just to switch applications. UltraMon will put a taskbar on all of your monitors. The UltraMon taskbar works just like the Windows one, it’ll only show the windows that are currently on that particular monitor. Also UltraMon enables you to setup keyboard shortcuts for moving a window from one monitor to another, I use Ctrl+Alt+Shift+Left/Right for moving a window to the previous/next monitor. UltraMon does a lot more, but these are the most important features. Oh yeah, it also enables you to make multi monitor wallpapers:</p>
<div class="imgwrapper" style=""><div><a href="/multi-monitoring-with-style/monitor_current2_2.jpg" class="fancy"><img src="/multi-monitoring-with-style/monitor_current2_2.jpg" style="max-height: 250px"/></a></div></div>

<p>UltraMon is a bargain at $39 for a non time limited version. <a href="http://www.realtimesoft.com/ultramon/" target="_blank">Click here to go the the UltraMon website</a>.</p>
<p>There’s a free alternative to UltraMon, MultiMon. While in my experience MultiMon did not work as stable and feature complete as UltraMon, it’s great if you don’t wanna spend the $39. <a href="http://www.mediachance.com/free/multimon.htm" target="_blank">Click here to go the the MultiMon website</a>.</p>
<h2 id="allSnap">allSnap</h2>
<p>allSnap makes all your window snap to the edges of your monitor(s), it may also snap to other windows, it can be customized to any way you like. allSnap is great when you have to have several windows open on one monitor, it makes it a lot quicker for you to resize the windows so you utilize your full monitor area.<a href="http://www.cs.utoronto.ca/~iheckman/allsnap/" target="_blank">Click here to go the the allSnap website</a>.</p>

				<p>As a programmer we strive to make our everyday lives easier. The very engine behind all innovation is lazyness, after all, if it weren’t for us being lazy, why would we use - and by that, have a need - for things like automobiles, computers and so forth?</p>
<a id="more"></a>

<p>I often meet people who aren’t aware of the many great tools that aid developers when debugging websites in Internet Explorer. I’ll mention a few of the most valuable ones that I use here.</p>
<p>If you know of any great tools that I’ve failed to mention, please let me know!</p>
<h2 id="Internet_Explorer_Developer_Toolbar"><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=e59c3964-672d-4511-bb3e-2d5e1db91038&amp;displaylang=en" target="_blank">Internet Explorer Developer Toolbar</a></h2>
<p>The IE developer toolbar places itself in the Internet Explorer toolbar area.</p>
<ul>
<li>Easily traverse the web page DOM. </li>
<li>Quickly disable features like javascript, cookies, popup blocker, etc. </li>
<li>Outline tables, cells, divs, images and so forth to easily be able to tell where your elements are on the webpage. </li>
<li>Quick links for validation of HTML, CSS and various other parts of your website through the W3 validator. </li>
<li>Resize your browser window to common resolutions. </li>
<li>Easily clear the cache, cookies or even your session - so you won’t have to restart IE.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are just some of the features the developer toolbar has, <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=e59c3964-672d-4511-bb3e-2d5e1db91038&amp;displaylang=en" target="_blank">see a full list of features at the download page.</a></p>
<h3 id="Fiddler"><a href="http://www.fiddlertool.com/fiddler/version.asp" target="_blank">Fiddler</a></h3>
<p>Fiddler enables you to catch incoming and outgoing HTTP requests and debug them before they’re sent or received. This enables you to follow the HTTP stream and debug possible problems. You can even set debug points and modify the requests and respones before they arrive at their destination. This is especially great if you’re developing applications that make requests behind-the-scene, like for instance, Flash applications that make HTTP requests themselves.</p>
<h3 id="HttpWatch"><a href="http://www.httpwatch.com/" target="_blank">HttpWatch</a></h3>
<p>HttpWatch is a more user friendly version of Fiddler. HttpWatch doesn’t have nearly as many features, you can’t set debug points or modify the requests/responses. What HttpWatch does have to offer is a much more slick and fast user interface, and direct integration into IE. Unless I have to use debug points I much prefer to use HttpWatch during my daily work. HttpWatch however is not free.</p>
<h3 id="ieHttpHeaders"><a href="http://www.blunck.se/iehttpheaders/iehttpheaders.html" target="_blank">ieHttpHeaders</a></h3>
<p>Suggested by Steve McCoole. ieHttpHeaders fall into the same category as Fiddler and HttpWatch, it gives a live display of the HTTP requests/responses. ieHttpHeaders only shows the headers, although both HttpWatch and Fiddler does this too, ieHttpHeaders is free (beats HttpWatch) and it’s neatly integrated into IE itself (beats Fiddler), so it definitely has value.</p>
<h3 id="IE_Powertoys_for_WebDevs"><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/ie/ie6/previous/webaccess/webdevaccess.mspx" target="_blank">IE Powertoys for WebDevs</a></h3>
<p>Don’t worry, although it says Internet Explorer 5, it works great in both IE6 and IE7. This WebDev powertoy enables a great feature in the IE context menu, “View partial source”. How many times have you not looked through a webpages source in Notepad, searching for a specific section? With the partial source view function you can simply highlight any part of the website and select “view partial source” and a window will open up, showing only that part of the webpages source, neat!</p>
<h3 id="Inline_Search"><a href="http://www.ieforge.com/InlineSearch/HomePage" target="_blank">Inline Search</a></h3>
<p>This tools mimics Firefox’s inline search function to near perfection. I for one love Firefox’s search function as it’s very quick to use and it doesn’t use a bulky modal dialog. This tool gives the exact same functionality in IE, it simply overwrites the usual search dialog.</p>
<h3 id="FullSource"><a href="http://www.thundermain.com/FullSource.html" target="_blank">FullSource</a></h3>
<p>Suggested by Steve McCoole. FullSource enables you to view the actual current source code of the page you’re viewing. That is, not the source code that was originally served to IE, but the source code that IE is currently rendering, including any DOM manipulations caused by JavaScript, XSL transformations etc.</p>
<h2 id="Non_IE_addons">Non IE addons</h2>
<p>Although the next two tools are not IE specific, I simply have to mention them as I use them to a great extent.</p>
<h3 id="ColorPic"><a href="http://iconico.com/colorpic/" target="_blank">ColorPic</a></h3>
<p>This is by far the best color picker tool that I’ve come across. It makes it a snap to pick colors with pixel precision, no matter if it’s from a webpage, application or windows itself.</p>
<h3 id="JRuler"><a href="http://www.spadixbd.com/freetools/jruler.htm" target="_blank">JRuler</a></h3>
<p>JRuler is exactly what the name implies, an onscreen ruler that can be used anywhere. It has great support for measuring in various units. Although there is a builtin ruler in the IE developer toolbar, this one also works outside IE.</p>

				<p>During the last couple of weeks, I have been giving lectures on the subject of .NET code protection at some of the danish universities.</p>
<a id="more"></a>

<p>Part of being a Microsoft Student Partner is exactly this, travelling the universities and spreading knowledge of the Microsoft platform. Naturally .NET is the most exciting topic to talk about as the primary audience mostly consists of computer scientists.</p>
<p>Due to my work as a MSP I’ve got my 2006 Tech-Ed conference entry ticket paid, so I’m taking a short trip to Barcelona on the 8th of november untill the 11th of november. Hopefully I’ll get a lot of hands-on experiences with the new technologies and platforms, I can’t wait!</p>
