				<p>Today I got up relatively early at about 1 PM. Before I knew of it, it had somehow become 7 PM, and several of us were starting to become quite hungry. We weren’t really in the mood for the usual fast food, and neither of use were turned on by the local sushi bar. Instead we went a couple hundred meters down Eastern Avenue to a local placed called ‘The T-Bird’. The scenery was a classical 60’s highway truckerstop place. It was kinda sad as it really looked like it was stuck in the 60’s.</p>

<p>When our waitress (very hot youngish blonde) came to take our orders, Morten wanted to order onion rings as a side dish, as well as french fries for his main order. There were some confusion as to whether he could do as he wanted, so this little conversation took place:</p>
<p>Morten: “Can I do that?”<br>Her: “You can have whatever you want”</p>
<p>Now Morten slowly looked at hear from top to bottom, slightly pausing on the breast area, whereafter he muttered a slowrolled “Okaaaay”. I guess you should’ve been there, we all cracked up for sure… I’m not sure if she got the “joke”.</p>
<p>When we got back we decided to go to our local casino / resort, the Green Valley Ranch. Just before we were about to lave, I got an SMS from my cousin Dennis. Dennis and a couple of his friends were in Vegas also, and he was asking if we could meet up tonight. Despite some communicational problems we managed to find each other outside the Circus Circus (I used about 10 minutes just looking for the Strip exit from that place… God I hate Circus Circus.</p>
<div class="imgwrapper" style=""><div><a href="/stripwalk/strip2_2.jpg" class="fancy"><img src="/stripwalk/strip2_2.jpg" style="max-height: 250px"/></a></div></div>

<p>As Dennis and his friends were all below 21, we couldn’t drink or anything, so we decided to go for a stripwalk instead, seeing some of the most fascinating strip hotels.</p>
<p>The without doubt most fascinating hotel I have seen thus far is the Venetian. The way they have recreated the Venetian canals, gondolas, the sky, walkways and everything is nothing but amazing.</p>

<p>After taking a trip by the Rio and the Luxor we split up as it was nearing 3 AM, Dennis and his friends were headed back towards LA at 11 AM that very next morning.</p>
<div class="imgwrapper" style=""><div><a href="/stripwalk/strip9_2.jpg" class="fancy"><img src="/stripwalk/strip9_2.jpg" style="max-height: 250px"/></a></div></div>

<p>After arriving back home at the camp, I and a couple of other guys that were awake watched some mexian/hispanic tv show that we understood absolutely nothing of, but it contained an overload of totally hot chicks, so we didn’t really mind not understanding what they said.</p>

				<p>… happened today. I got up early (around 2 PM) as I really needed to be able to go to bed early tonight. Tomorrow is the second day of the WSOP Main Event tournament. They’re expected the day to last around 15 hours like the first day, so I will need to be well rested, unlike on day one.</p>

<p>I went to the New York New York tonight for a dinner party arranged on the 2+2 forums. We met up at the ESPN Zone and got a couple of beers, some above average fast food and then we split up again.</p>
<p>I bought myself a nifty little camera today (Sony DSC-W50) today that is small enough for me to fit it in my pocket. This means I’ll be able to take a lot more of pictures during the day as my main camera (Sony DSC-R1) is a bit too large to bring into the Spearmint and such places.</p>
<p>I’m off to bed now (1 AM). We’re taking a cab to the Rio tomorrow at around 10 AM, hoping to be able to get some breakfast in there before the crowd starts moving in.</p>

				<p>I got up at my usual time today, around 6 PM. We were headed to Ballys to get drunk and maybe play some drunk poker. We got a seat in their 1/2 NL game pretty quickly.</p>
<a id="more"></a>

<p>I didn’t really like Ballys poker room. It didn’t consist of more than 6-7 tables max so it’s a small room. The chairs were very good, a lot better than at the Rio. The tables on the other hand, I hated the felt. It’s hard to describe, but it felt a lot softer than at Rio, meaning that cards were more often sticking to the felt, chips weren’t sliding the same way. I can’t believe that I at my fourth cash game session already talk about how minor differences of the table felt actually has an influence on my liking of the room, I shouldn’t be noticing this before I’d become a regular nit at a poker room.</p>
<p>I dumped about $450 at the table playing totally laggy, straddling, minraising, bluffing nits and everything… With no success. Most of my money ended up at Mikael and Rune so I guess it’s not totally wasted.</p>
<p>After leaving the poker table we went to play some video poker. Video poker is absolutely GREAT if you want to get drunk. You just sit up at the bar and play. While you play, drinks are on the house. I ended up being stuck about $60 playing jacks or better, but if you play it optimally (I did not) you can really get wasted for as little as $20.</p>
<p>After Ballys we were supposed to go the the Vodoo Bar at the Rio, but after a thorough consideration of our looks we came to the conclusion that there was no way in hell we were going to be let in. Oh well, some stayed at the video poker tables, I went with Helge and Thijs to the Rio cash games.</p>
<p>I got a seat at the 2/5 NL game right away (there’s never any queues at 2 AM). The table actually wasn’t that juicy, there were a couple of good players, and the rest weren’t exactly good, but they knew how to play. There were one real nit at the table. He was a typical WPT look a like, big glasses, cap, very serious look at his face all the time. He took like 5 minutes considering to call a $40 raise preflop, finally folding in a really provocative manner. He was so pissed with me since I constantly Mississippi straddled into his big blind, I was really working him up to a major steamer, unfortunately I never got his stack.</p>
<p>To my direct right was a totally wasted American, great guy. We chatted a lot, he was convinced that I was an online player on the Fortune network since he had this Danish guy from Aarhus that had his number dialed when he played online. I kept refusing it, but he didn’t really trust me. I had great success in manipulating his play by chatting to him through the hands, I got him to pay me off on my set in a pot of around $350.</p>
<p>There weren’t any really big hands this session. I won a lot of minor pots, winning a couple of okay pots with TPTK and so forth. All in all I worked my stack upwards of around $1k. I left at 6 AM since it was getting late and the table really wasn’t juicy any more. The wasted American had left, the WPT hero was becoming more and more nitty and there weren’t any real donators left.</p>
<p>I got an offer of $5k for 50% of my WSOP ME winnings that I declined. I can’t say if the offer really was for real, but my read on the guy was that he was the real deal. I declined it as I don’t really need $5k, and I believe that my current position is somewhat more worth. I mean, I’ve got about 3/4 average stack (18.5k / 26k-ish) and I don’t really feel outclassed yet.</p>
<p><strong>Result for this session: <span style="color: #008040;">$466</span></strong><br><strong>Overall cash game result: <span style="color: #008040;">$1568</span></strong></p>

				<p>After Santana I went to Rio with Abuello to see if we could get an update on how Mika (Miwala) was doing in the Main Event, and Danes in general. While we didn’t find Mika (later on I found out he busted earlier on to a nasty rivered flush vs. rivered full house hand), I did meet Hostrup (Carl) waiting for cash game entry. I signed up for the $2/5 NL game also.</p>
<a id="more"></a>

<p>After about 10 minutes I got called over the speaker, my seat was ready. Luckily I got a seat at Hostrups table, in fact I got the seat directly right of Hostrup. It was seat #1, yuck, the seats right next to the dealer sucks.</p>
<p>The game was really juicy, there were some really awful players at our table. Carl and I really lagged up the game, raising a lot. We also Mississippi straddled each time we could (explanation later on). No one could blame us for colluding, we really battled it out the two of us. At one point i loose around $300 in a pot. I can’t remember exactly what happened, but I semi-bluff reraise Carl all in on a board like xxJ with 77 (both X’s being lower than 7). He calls and shows QQ, takes down the pot. I rebuy for another $500.</p>
<p>At one point I get into a pot with an obviously non-experienced player sitting across me. He has around $400, I have about $1.000. I can’t really remember neither the hand nor the action, but that’s not the point of the story either. I bet on the flop, and he goes into the tank, clearly pondering of doing a reraise. He asks me how much I have left, I simply answer, “I’ve got you covered”. He insists on hearing how much I have, fair enough, “I have about a k” (k = $1.000). He then thinks a bit longer, and then he asks me how many bills I have. Seriously, that’s one retarded question, it does not friggin matter, I have him covered. So now I answer him in a bit more irritated way, “It does not matter, I have you covered!”. He continues to insist on knowing how many bills I have. I end up counting the bills and more or less yelling it at him. He then thinks for a bit longer and AGAIN he asks how many chips I have. I HAVE YOU COVERED; THAT IS ALL YOU NEED TO KNOW!”. He then goes on defending on why it matters to know how many bills I have. Oh my god I got upset with this guy. I have you fucking covered, would you please just act and shut the fuck up? He ends up folding, clearly irritated over being taught how the mechanics of the game. I don’t mind as I was on a pure bluff, I really considered showing my hand as that would’ve put him on an incredible steamer. I didn’t though as I feared it would’ve resulted in him leaving the game.</p>
<div class="imgwrapper" style=""><div><a href="/cashsession3/money_2.jpg" class="fancy"><img src="/cashsession3/money_2.jpg" style="max-height: 250px"/></a></div></div>

<p>The session ends in me winning a brutal hand over Hostrup (sorry). I get KQo in the SB and bet out 35 (I were first due to a Mississippi straddle). Hostrup is the sole caller. Flop comes with a beautiful 9TJ, two of a suit. I bet out around $60 I think. Hostrup then raises to $200. Earlier on Hostrup has pushed me out of a lot of pots, including a very similar situation where he showed a flush draw. So I mutter, “You have the flush draw, eh?”. Make it $500! Hostrup thinks for a moment then pushes his stack in, I guess he had around $7-800, I instacall. He shows black queens for an overpair + open ended straight draw. The turn brings a 9 which pairs the board, yuck. At this point I already imagined the Q/9 on the river to fill up his boat. I was excited over the 4 that came along on the river. A $1500 pot is not that normal in a $2/5 game.</p>
<p>A Mississippi straddle is a weird straddle. It originated on the each coast and is usually only played there. It enables you to straddle when you’re on the button (you get 1st choice over an UTG straddle). It effectively improves your already good position as the SB is now first to act preflop (worsening their already terrible positions), and at the same time you double the stakes. So in a game were you have an edge, this is an absolute must-do. You improve your position and heighten the stakes, an even better opportunity to get the fishes money.</p>
<p><strong>Result for this session: <span style="color: #008040;">$1327</span> </strong><br><strong>Overall cash game result: <span style="color: #008040;">$1102</span></strong></p>

				<p>Today was the big day. Today was the day that I was going to play the WSOP 2006 Main Event with a $10k buy in!</p>
<a id="more"></a>

<div class="imgwrapper" style=""><div><a href="/mainevent2006/day1_2.jpg" class="fancy"><img src="/mainevent2006/day1_2.jpg" style="max-height: 250px"/></a></div></div>

<p>I guess it was a bad “decision” to only sleep 5 hours that night. I woke up at around 6 AM and couldn’t sleep any more. Not because I was overly nervous, though I guess the excitement might’ve played in unconsciously.</p>
<p>I got at my table at about 11:50 AM, pretty unknown table, no one I recognized, I suppose that’s good. I quickly took the lead at our table, I was clearly the one playing the most aggressive game. I raised a lot of drawing hands, TJ in position, 67s and so forth. I took down a lot of minor pots, including a sizeable 3k pot towards a 2+2’er sitting to my left (Durron597).</p>
<p>At one point we got a new player to the table, a real American original. He was constantly laughing in a dumb way, acting kind of retarded. He’d painted his fingernails white with royal flush symbols on each fingernail on both hands, yuck! At one point Norman Chad came over to me asking why I’d misspelled “Scrub” on my cap (I had a cap with the text “SKRUB” on it), one of the production managers had seen it and wondered what the story was. He asked if it was because I was one of those dumb internet qualifiers (in a jokingly way). Of course I answered, “Yeah, I AM one of those dumb internet qualifiers, though that isn’t the reason for the misspelling”. And then i give him the story of it being a Danish poker slang word for having luck / a good run of cards. The original went totally nuts when Norm came over talking to me, he was totally excited that one of the known ESPN commentators was at our table, so he made him aware of his fingernail painting, obviously very proud of it. Before long he’d convinced Norm to get the ESPN TV crew over to film it. While this was going all, I, together with my end of the table, were laughing our buts off.</p>
<p>After the first break I got absolutely no hands. I tried squeezing the pot sometimes but it seemed like the table had picked up on my style, and people weren’t playing nearly as scared as they began with, so all in all I had to slow down a touch. After about 6 hours or so from the start I was moved to table 128, having about 15k in chips. This table was a catastrophe for me position wise. On my direct right were <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norm_MacDonald" target="_blank">Norm MacDonald</a>, and two spots to my left were <a href="http://pokerdb.thehendonmob.com/player.php?a=r&amp;n=42675" target="_blank">Mark Vos</a>.</p>
<p>Norm had around 45k in chips, and Mark had around 35-40k also, they were without doubt the two chipleaders of the tournament, and I was sitting right in between, great!</p>
<p>I still didn’t pick up any hands, so I was just sitting tight. I tried squeezing a couple of times as well as bluffing it down on the flop, but the players at this table were far better players than on my first table, so it was a lot more difficult.</p>
<p>After about 30 minutes came a crazy hand. Blinds are about 50/100. Norm raises it preflop, Mark is the sole caller. The flop comes 9QJ. Norm bets. Mark raises. Norm thinks for a bit and then pushes all in. The all in push from Norm was a major overbet. Mark thinks for about a minute before he calls and tables QJ, beating Norms black aces. This was a major call for Mark, top two is a great hand, but 9QJ is a very dangerous flop, and Norm could easily have had a set, even KT was possible. No help for Norm and he’s almost out, Mark doubling up to an incredible chiplead. Norm is steaming and he plays a couple of terrible hands and ends up busting with KK towards an Ax hand catching an ace.</p>
<p>Luckily Mark was playing very tight passive after gaining the massive chip lead, I feared he’d be raising me out of most pots, luckily he didn’t. A new guy joined our table in Norms place, Flaminio from Italy. Very cool dude, got a good chat with him and he rooted for me when I was in tight spots. Chatting it up with players during the poker play is one of the greatest moments when playing poker. Although we’re battling it out against each other, you make some great friends.</p>
<p>The rest of my time at table 128 wasn’t really that spectacular, I didn’t get any great hands (my best hand all day was QQ), so nothing special really happened. At one point I had around 17k, I raised it preflop with A9o in MP, one guy called from the button. Flop comes three rags, 256 or something like that. I bet out around half pot. He comes over the top with a sizeable bet. I can’t really figure out what hand he should have that would’ve hit that flop. A set wouldn’t raise, on overpair would’ve raised me preflop. I put him on TJ-AK, some kind of overcard combination. I come over the top. He gets into the tank, thinking for a long time before he pushes his last chips in. I instamuck while puking into my water bottle. After this i had around 7k chips left.</p>
<p>I worked my way up to around 11k in chips before i got moved to my last table of the day at around 12 AM. This new table was a lot better for me. The players could clearly play poker, but they were so easy to read, and they were playing very scared. I picked up a lot of pots by simply playing the players. I received no cards at all during these final four hours, but i really ruled the table. When we had about 30 minutes left it got even better, everybody were playing soooo scared since they wouldn’t want to bust 30 minutes before we ended the day.</p>
<p>At one time i raised with QJ in LP (i had around 17k). A guy in the SB looked at me while thinking for some time. He sighed, really letting me know that he didn’t like the situation. Finally he said “oh what the heck” and shoved in his chips. I instamucked. He was so clearly acting, and his hand was shaking like a bunny having sex, it was so obvious he had a great hand. He tabled AA while looking a bit sad that he didn’t get my call. He asked me if there was any amount I would’ve called. “Nope, you shake too much”. Clearly he was not aware at all that he was shaking, and even less of it being a tell. Normally I wouldn’t notify a player of me picking up their tells, but we had 20 minutes left of the day and all odds are against me ever playing with him again. This also enabled me to constantly hit his blind and push him off hands as he was clearly scared of me.</p>
<p>The day ended with me having 18.425 chips, about 2/3rds of the average of about 27k. I am extremely satisfied with my play during the 1st day of the main event. This was without doubt the best poker I had ever played! I got no cards all day. I had no real hands that made my day, most of it was simply me playing the people instead of the cards. What surprised me the most was the fatigue such an event imposes upon you. I mean, how hard can it be to play cards for 16 straight hours? Pretty god damn hard! You have to be constantly concentrated for 16 hours straight, follow the action, remember all action and everything. From about 12 AM everybody were yawning. I was so ready to sleep when we were done at about 4 AM.</p>

<p>Anyways, someone knocks on my door hard while I sleep. I look at my cellphone to see the time, my eyes are all hazy. Hot damn, it’s like 6:25 PM, yikes, I guess I really needed that sleep. We had to be at the MGM Grand at 7:30 PM since we were going to see Santana live that night.</p>
<div class="imgwrapper" style=""><div><a href="/santana/Santana_2.jpg" class="fancy"><img src="/santana/Santana_2.jpg" style="max-height: 250px"/></a></div></div>

<p>We couldn’t get a cab, so we decided to go out to the street and see if we could get one. After standing there for like 30 minutes without being able to hail a cab we’re getting kind of nervous as the clock’s around 7 PM, and it takes about 20 minutes to get to the strip. We decide to walk into the nearest 7-eleven and see if we can get a ride with someone. After a couple of tries we get in touch with an American guy that says that although he has a pickup, he’d take us, although he’d have to talk with his wife first. He goes outside, has a quick chat with his wife, and then he waves us out. Really cool guy / couple, they drove us straight to the MGM Grand entrance. While he insisted on not taking any money, I threw $50 into the backseat of his pickup and said I insisted. He smiled, gave me his hand and said thanks.</p>
<p>We quickly met up with the others and went into the MGM Grand Arena. Damn what a place. That hall is so unbelievable big, and it was inside the MGM itself, everything in Vegas is just extremely large. Mark Hamilton was warming up, I guess he was okay, but the sound was far too loud so it really ruined the experience.</p>
<p>At about 9 PM Santana came on. It started out with a video of a white peace dove flying, it was so grand a scenery / experience, one couldn’t avoid getting goose bumps simply due to the feeling. It’s impossible to describe a concert, but it was breathtaking, Santana is nothing short of amazing on the guitar. I really liked his small speeches in between the songs. After a short speech of us having to be thankful to god for being born into this world, he said, “We are opposite of George Bush… Compassion. Humanity. Kindness… We are opposite of George Bush”. The hall went into an uproar of applause, it was so great.</p>

				<p>So today I got up a bit earlier, at around 4 PM. At about 9 PM I took a cab into the Rio together with a couple of the other guys to pick up my Main Event registration, this time there were no problems, thank god.</p>
<a id="more"></a>

<p>I decided to sit down for some cash games since I was nowhere near ready to head for bed, so I bought into the usual 2/5 NL game for $500. Today I got a somewhat worse table than last time, worse in the way that people were a lot better. Most of the guys at the table knew how to play, though only a couple seemed to be really good. There were a couple of nits among them, one guy constantly complaining about everything, even when I politely told the table that I had seen the color of a card the dealer had dealt. He asked me which color it was, “Red”, “Haha, that’s easy to say, they’re both red” - well excuse me, it’s fine with me if you wanna play those cards when half the table knows about it.</p>
<p>I catch no cards at all, I just sit tight and blind down. There’s a friendly young guy to my left who’s clearly a good player who I’d chatted a bit with. I get 72o in the BB, he raises it to 20 UTG, everybody folds to me, I call. The flop comes Kd5c2s. Check, he bet’s 30, I call. Turn comes with a blank, something like 8h. I bet out 50, he thinks for a short while and then calls. The river comes with another blank, a 3 of some kind. I bet out 80, I’m trying not to make it too large, i want it to look as if I’m milking him with my flopped set. He goes into the tank, looks at me - I just smile back at him. He finally mucks K9o, and he’s clearly frustrated when i table my 72o. I had to loosen up the table a bit, it was simply getting too tight’n’nitty.</p>
<p>There’s sitting this donk a couple of seats to my right, he’s the only real donator at the table. He’s just won a major put with a runner runner flush against another guys TPTK, allin on the turn. I get QcQs in EP, raise to around 35. Two callers, including the donkey. Flop comes something like Td5c3c, a perfect safe flop for me. I bet out 3/4 pot, he calls. Turn comes with the 8c, I bet out around 1/2 pot, he calls again. River comes with a complete blank, and this time I bet out around 1/2 pot again. He ponders for a couple of seconds and then announces “Call”. I was pretty sure I had him beat, until he tables Kc6c for the second nut flush. Now, I could handle being beat, but why the f<em>*</em> could he not just bet/raise his hand so he would get paid? Damned donkey.</p>
<p>Down to around 260. I get KK in the EP, I raise it to 40, donkey calls. Flop comes very safe again, Jh5s7d, the pots around 100. I bet around 80, and the donkey moves all in. Since i only had around 260 from the beginning, I am now facing a rather large pot with a short stack, so naturally I have to call, again I expect i’m good, he probably has something like AT. Unfortunately he tables 55 and I’m dead.</p>
<p>Overall a crappy session. I had okay control over the table, flopped pretty good, caught some okay hands at times, but constantly someone else outflopped me.</p>
<p><strong>Result for this session: </strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>$647</strong><br></span><strong>Overall cash game result: <span style="color: #ff0000;">$225</span></strong></p>
<p>The incompetence of most dealers continue to amaze me. I’ve had several dealers that were simply too slow and inexperienced to deal a poker game. Some of them are so fat that they can’t reach more than halfway around the table compared to others, again slowing the game down. Also today I had a situation, a lot of limpers, somebody raises to 15, a lot of callers, somebody calls all in for $3 more. Then the dealer stops, “I don’t even know if that’s a raise, anybody know?”, dude, that’s an overcall!</p>
<p>Of course there are also positive moments. I had my best dealer ever today, a guy called James from Sudan. He dealt those cards at amazing haste, had total control, always great and fast information, “Raise it up, call, call, fold, three to the flop” and so forth. Later on I had an asian woman, Mimi, incredibly sweet. Not the fastest dealer of all, but constantly smiling at people, even the dorky nits. I just couldn’t help tipping her a dime when she left, saying she did a good job.</p>

<p>Tomorrow is the big day. Tomorrow is my main event day. Tomorrow is the day my luck turns. Tomorrow is the day I’m gonna build my chipstack through the roof.</p>

				<p>So tonight I woke up at 7:30 PM for some reason. I have no idea how I could sleep that late, I mean, it wasn’t more than like 6:30 AM when I got back from the Rio last night. But whatever, it was great to get some sleep. At around 10 PM we went to the Pokerteam DK party at their house on the other side of the strip. Great party, lots of danish poker players, cool to have a danish gathering. Norsemen were holding their own party in a house right next to us. It was also cool to put faces on guys like bad_ip and zweig, they were much younger / teenageish than I’d imagined.</p>
<a id="more"></a>

<p>Due to a promise we all made, I will have to sum up the rest of the night in the following picture:</p>

				<p>So I finally arrived at Vegas!</p>
<a id="more"></a>

<div class="imgwrapper" style=""><div><a href="/arrivalatvegas/pool1_4.jpg" class="fancy"><img src="/arrivalatvegas/pool1_4.jpg" style="max-height: 250px"/></a></div></div>

<h2 id="Lack_of_space">Lack of space</h2>
<p>After a grueling trip of about 24 hours I finally arrived at our house in Vegas. As expected the overseas flight was a living hell due to my size and the lack of space in tourist class. To make it even worse, since I last flew with SAS, all passenger seats in tourist class now has their own little TFT monitor. Why is that bad? That is bad because these monitors run off a computer placed below one of the seats in the foot area. Naturally i got the seat which had the computer, so while I was already struggling with the lack of space, I now only had half the foot space that everyone else did.</p>
<p>On the plus side, all overseas SAS flights now have onboard internet via WIFI. How cool is that, surfing on the internet at an altitude of 30k feet?</p>
<h2 id="Immigration_troubles">Immigration troubles</h2>
<p>At Chicago I almost didn’t make it through immigration.</p>
<p>I had my Pokernet t-shirt on with a little Pokernet logo and some cards. Besides my t-shirt, the immigration officer could naturally also see that my destination was Vegas, so by putting 2 and 2 together, he figured i was headed there to gamble (duh). He politely asked me, ‘Are you a professional gambler?’. I smiled and answered him honestly, ‘No I am not’.</p>
<ul>
<li>Officer: ‘Are you here to play the WSOP?’  </li>
<li>Me: ‘Yes I am’  </li>
<li>Officer: ‘Did you put down the money yourself?’  </li>
<li>Me: ‘Yes i did’  </li>
<li>Officer: ‘So nobody is sponsoring your entry? You have paid everything yourself?’  </li>
<li>Me: ‘I won my entry in an online satellite tournament, so no, i didn’t put down the 10 grand myself’  </li>
<li>Officer: ‘What site was that?’  </li>
<li>Me: ‘Party Poker’</li>
</ul>
<p>And then he gave me the whole long speech. “You should now, you’re really out on a line here”. He warned me that they did not look kindly upon foreign poker players entering the US and playing their tournaments while bringing back home the money they won. He did let me go though. I have no idea where that speech came from. I guess it might be due to the Goodlatte bill that is currently a very hot topic in the House/Senate.</p>
<h2 id="Pokernet_camp">Pokernet camp</h2>
<p>I am staying in the house that Pokernet has set up. We’re probably around 10-11 guys staying there at the moment, and how can you expect anything but a mess when 10 poker playing guys are living together?</p>
<div class="imgwrapper" style=""><div><a href="/arrivalatvegas/house1_2.jpg" class="fancy"><img src="/arrivalatvegas/house1_2.jpg" style="max-height: 250px"/></a></div></div>

<p>The house is great. Everybody’s beating me in pool, but whatever, it’s great fun trying anyways :D We’ve got In’n’Out burgers nearby, a 7-Eleven, taco thingy, Burgerking and so forth.</p>

<p>Finally the day arrived, I’ve just turned 21! At four minutes past midnight I registered for my WSOP Players card at the Rio, while being registered I got a good chat with the girl behind the counter, she laughed a bit when she saw my ‘I support single moms’ t-shirt - she said she liked it.</p>
<a id="more"></a>

<p>I also got an application made for my ITIN number, just in case I make a major cash in one of the tournaments, it would be a serious bad beat if I were forced to leave behind 30% of my winnings due to US tax laws.</p>
<div class="imgwrapper" style=""><div><a href="/wsop37/wsop2_2.jpg" class="fancy"><img src="/wsop37/wsop2_2.jpg" style="max-height: 250px"/></a></div></div>

<p>I arrive at a semi-good table. There’s about four players that I quickly recognize as being good players, whereof one of them has a highly tuned luckbox. The luckbox quickly becomes the chipleader at the table, bullying others around. There’s no doubt that he was a good player, but seriously, he just hit his hands. There was also a noshow at my table that had yet to show up when I busted after about three and a half hours, he had around t300 left (starting stack = 1500). I guess he was a better player than me, he must’ve read Harrington, he played kinda tight.</p>
<p>The first guy went out after about 10 minutes in a sick sick hand. Two limpers (the luckbox in the BB) see a flop of 779r, they both get all in. The first limper shows 99 for the flopped full house, too bad that our luckbox just flopped quads with his 77! That is without doubt the sickest beat i’ve seen live, mind you that I haven’t played much live though.</p>
<p>The luckbox quick get’s irritated with me as i’m sitting a couple of spots before him, continuously stealing his blinds. It ends up in the inevitable blind battle where I raise with 44 (no spades). He calls. The flop comes QsJs8s. I try to make a CR/bluff, but unfortunately he pushes and I’m forced to fold, having about t1000 left.</p>
<p>After this battle I suddenly stop getting hands, i get absolutely nothing. And before i know it, blinds are at 100/200 and i’m sitting with like t600 left. It’s foleded to me in LMP. I look down and see a nice couple of ladies and i push it in. It’s folded around to the luckbox who again goes into the tank while giving me the smirky look. He calls about 400 chips more into the pot of about 900 and shows 75o. Great, I’m a good favorite with about 82%. Unfortunately the flop comes 725r, he flopped two pair. The turn brings another 5 which brings me down to a total of two outs, the last two queens. Unfortunately the river is a blank jack, and i’m eliminated from the tournament at around midways into the 100/200 level.</p>
<p>Also I just received a second confirmation email from Harrah’s for my main event entry, they’ve suddenly moved my starting day from 1B to 1A. It doesn’t matter much to me as i’m already in Vegas, but seriously, how can Harrah’s change ones starting day three days before the tournament starts? What if I’d already made plans? This is no $1000 event we’re talking about, this is the $10.000 WSOP Main Event. Once again Harrah’s shows it’s incompetence.</p>
